      "2. **Traversal along the latent basis**: Identifying the latent basis in the latent space allows for editing images by traversing along the basis, enabling control over specific features or attributes of the generated images.\n",
      "3. **Editing strength and quality deficiency at timesteps**: Measuring editing strength and quality deficiency at each timestep can help design a generative process that achieves versatile editing and high-quality image generation.\n",
      "4. **Discovering semantic latent space in frozen pretrained diffusion models**: Analyzing the structure of the latent space in pretrained diffusion models can reveal semantic properties, enabling more effective image editing and manipulation.\n",
      "5. **Using the bottleneck activation as a suitable space for semantic image manipulation**: The bottleneck of the UNet denoising model has been identified as a suitable space for semantic image manipulation in diffusion models.\n",
