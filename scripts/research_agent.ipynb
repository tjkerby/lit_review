The latent space of diffusion models_\\nGANs have a well-defined latent space suitable for semantic editing. To which extent DDMs possess such a convenient\\nlatent space is still a topic of ongoing research. Here we start\\nby reviewing two approaches for defining a latent space in\\nDDMs that facilitate semantic editing. Using DDIM sampling proposed by Song et al. [39],\\nthe generative process is a deterministic mapping from a\\nGaussian noise vector xT ∼N (0, I) to a sampled image x0. In the DDIM framework, the fully noised image xT, can\\nbe regarded as the latent representation. DDIM has the\\nproperty that fixing xT leads to images with similar highlevel features irrespective of the length of the generative\\nprocess. Furthermore, interpolating between two latent codes\\n**x[(1)]T** and x[(2)]T leads to images that vary smoothly between\\nthe two corresponding endpoint images, x[(1)]0 and x[(2)]0 [.]\\n\\n\\nKwon et al. [14] propose h-space for DDMs, the set\\nof bottleneck feature maps of the U-Net [29] across all\\ntimesteps, {hT, . . ., h1} as the latent space. Each bottleneck\\nfeature map ht has a lower spatial dimension but more\\nchannels than the output image. They show that semantics\\ncan be edited by adding offsets ∆ht to the feature maps\\nduring the generative process. To find editing directions, they\\nuse an optimization procedure involving CLIP, where the\\nsemantics to be edited are described by text prompts. The hspace has the following properties: (i) a direction ∆ht has the\\nsame semantic effect on different samples; (ii) the magnitude\\nof ∆ht controls the strength of the edit; (iii) h-space is\\nadditive in the sense that applying a linear combination of\\ndifferent directions where each ∆ht corresponds to a distinct\\nattribute, results in a generated image where all attributes\\nhave been changed. _B.

In practice, our Smooth Diffusion is trained on top of\\na well-known text-to-image model: Stable Diffusion [62]. We examine and demonstrate that Smooth Diffusion dramatically improves the latent space smoothness over its\\nbaseline. Meanwhile, we conduct extensive research across\\nnumerous downstream tasks, including but not limited to\\nimage interpolation, inversion, editing, etc. Both qualitative\\nand quantitative results support our conclusion that Smooth\\nDiffusion can be the next-gen high-performing generative\\nmodel not only for the baseline text-to-image task but across\\nvarious downstream tasks. ## 2. Related Work\\n\\n**Diffusion models are initiated from a family of prior works**\\nincluding but not limited to [8, 66, 70, 76]. Since then,\\nDDPM [24] introduced an image-based noise prediction\\nmodel, becoming one of the most popular image generation\\nresearch. Later works [12, 48, 71] extended DDPM, demonstrating that diffusion models perform on-par and even surpass GAN-based methods [15, 30–33]. Recently, generating images from text prompts (T2I) become an emerging field [11, 19, 28, 47, 62], among which diffusion models [16, 49, 59, 62, 64] have become quite visible to the\\npublic. For example, Stable Diffusion (SD) [62] consists of\\nVAE [36] and CLIP [58], diffuses latent space, and yields an\\noutstanding balance between quality and speed. Following\\nSD [62], researchers also explored diffusion approaches for\\ncontrols such as ControlNet [14, 26, 46, 57, 80, 85, 86, 89–\\n91, 95] and multimodal such as Versatile Diffusion [6, 41,\\n73, 88]. Works from a different track reduce diffusion steps\\nto improve speed [5, 34, 39, 43, 65, 72, 92, 96], or restrict\\ndata and domain for few-shot learning [20, 25, 40, 63], all\\nhad successfully maintained a high output quality. **Smooth latent space was one of the prominent proper-**\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nties of SOTA GAN works [9, 31–33], while exploring such\\nproperty went through the decade-long GAN research [3,\\n15], whose goals were mainly robust training. Ideas such as\\nWasserstein GAN [4, 17] had proved to be effective, which\\nenforced the Lipschitz continuity on discriminator via gradient penalties. Another technique, namely path length regularization, related to the Jacobian clamping in [51], was\\nadapted in StyleGAN2 [32] and later became a standard setting for GAN-based generators [10, 37, 87, 94]. Benefiting\\nfrom the smoothness property, researchers managed to manipulate latent space in many downstream research projects. Works such as [7, 50, 68, 83] explored latent space disentanglement. GAN-inverse [1, 2, 52, 84] had also proved\\nto be feasible, along with a family of image editing approaches [18, 53, 56, 60, 61, 74, 97]. As aforementioned,\\nour work aims to investigate the latent space smoothness for\\ndiffusion models, which by far remains unexplored. ## 3.', 'search_document: 2022; Hu\\net al. 2023c) has played a significant role in driving these\\nadvancements, prompting further investigations into the understanding of the learned latent space and its potential use\\nfor image editing tasks.

We used the pullback metric\\nto identify the latent and tangent bases in X and H. The latent basis found by the pullback metric\\nallows editing images by traversal along the basis. We have observed properties of the bases in two\\naspects. First, we discovered that 1) the latent bases evolve from low- to high-frequency components;\\n2) the discrepancy of tangent spaces from different samples increases along the generative process;\\nand 3) DMs trained on simpler datasets exhibit more consistent tangent spaces over timesteps. Second,\\nwe investigated how the latent structure changes based on the text conditions in Stable Diffusion,\\nand discovered that similar prompts make tangent space analogous but its effect becomes weaker\\nover timesteps.

      "\n",
      "## I. Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for generative tasks, offering a unique approach to image and data synthesis. These models work by iteratively refining the input noise signal until a realistic output is generated. However, controlling the generation process in diffusion models can be challenging due to the complex and high-dimensional nature of their latent spaces. In this report, we will explore the various ways that the structure of a latent space in a diffusion model can be leveraged to control the generation process.\n",
      "\n",
      "## II. Background: Diffusion Models and Latent Spaces\n",
      "\n",
      "Diffusion models are based on a Markov chain that progressively refines the input noise signal until a realistic output is generated. The latent space in a diffusion model represents the intermediate states of this refinement process, where each state corresponds to a specific level of detail or abstraction. Understanding the properties of latent spaces, such as their dimensionality and structure, is crucial for controlling the generation process.\n",
      "\n",
      "## III. Methods for Leveraging Latent Space Structure\n",
      "\n",
      "Several methods can be employed to leverage the structure of latent spaces in diffusion models:\n",
      "\n",
      "### A. Conditional Generation\n",
      "\n",
      "Conditional generation involves manipulating the latent space to produce specific outputs based on conditioning variables such as class labels or attributes. This can be achieved by modifying the diffusion process to incorporate conditioning information, allowing for targeted control over the generated output.\n",
      "\n",
      "### B. Latent Space Editing\n",
      "\n",
      "Latent space editing enables targeted changes to generated outputs by identifying and manipulating specific features or attributes in the latent space. Techniques such as optimization-based methods or random walks can be used to explore the latent space and identify the desired edits.\n",
      "\n",
      "### C. Latent Space Exploration\n",
      "\n",
      "Exploring the latent space can help discover new and interesting outputs, which can be achieved through techniques such as random walks or optimization-based methods. This allows for the identification of novel or diverse outputs that may not have been generated otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "### D. Disentanglement and Factorization\n",
      "\n",
      "Disentanglement and factorization involve separating factors of variation in the latent space, enabling independent control over different attributes or features. Techniques such as VAEs or InfoGANs can be used to learn disentangled representations, which can then be manipulated to achieve specific effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "### E. Latent Space Regularization\n",
      "\n",
      "Regularization techniques can be applied to the latent space to control generation by penalizing large distances or promoting sparsity. This helps improve mode coverage and reduce artifacts in the generated outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "## IV. Applications and Case Studies\n",
      "\n",
      "The methods outlined above have been successfully applied in various applications, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Image generation and editing: Latent space manipulation has been used to achieve impressive results in image editing tasks such as object removal or attribute transfer.\n",
      "* Text-to-image synthesis: Conditional generation has been employed to generate images based on text prompts, demonstrating the potential of diffusion models for text-to-image synthesis.\n",
      "* Data augmentation and generation for downstream tasks: Latent space exploration and editing have been used to generate new training data for downstream tasks such as object detection or segmentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## V. Conclusion and Future Directions\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, leveraging the structure of latent spaces in diffusion models offers a powerful means of controlling the generation process. The methods outlined above provide a range of techniques for achieving targeted control over generated outputs, from conditional generation to latent space editing and exploration. However, there are still many open research questions and potential future directions, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Improving the efficiency and scalability of latent space manipulation techniques\n",
      "* Developing new applications and use cases for controlled generation\n",
      "* Investigating the theoretical foundations of latent space structure and its relationship to generation quality\n",
      "\n",
      "By exploring these avenues, researchers can unlock the full potential of diffusion models and develop more sophisticated tools for generative tasks. \n",

In practice, our Smooth Diffusion is trained on top of\\na well-known text-to-image model: Stable Diffusion [62]. We examine and demonstrate that Smooth Diffusion dramatically improves the latent space smoothness over its\\nbaseline. Meanwhile, we conduct extensive research across\\nnumerous downstream tasks, including but not limited to\\nimage interpolation, inversion, editing, etc. Both qualitative\\nand quantitative results support our conclusion that Smooth\\nDiffusion can be the next-gen high-performing generative\\nmodel not only for the baseline text-to-image task but across\\nvarious downstream tasks. ## 2. Related Work\\n\\n**Diffusion models are initiated from a family of prior works**\\nincluding but not limited to [8, 66, 70, 76]. Since then,\\nDDPM [24] introduced an image-based noise prediction\\nmodel, becoming one of the most popular image generation\\nresearch. Later works [12, 48, 71] extended DDPM, demonstrating that diffusion models perform on-par and even surpass GAN-based methods [15, 30–33]. Recently, generating images from text prompts (T2I) become an emerging field [11, 19, 28, 47, 62], among which diffusion models [16, 49, 59, 62, 64] have become quite visible to the\\npublic. For example, Stable Diffusion (SD) [62] consists of\\nVAE [36] and CLIP [58], diffuses latent space, and yields an\\noutstanding balance between quality and speed. Following\\nSD [62], researchers also explored diffusion approaches for\\ncontrols such as ControlNet [14, 26, 46, 57, 80, 85, 86, 89–\\n91, 95] and multimodal such as Versatile Diffusion [6, 41,\\n73, 88]. Works from a different track reduce diffusion steps\\nto improve speed [5, 34, 39, 43, 65, 72, 92, 96], or restrict\\ndata and domain for few-shot learning [20, 25, 40, 63], all\\nhad successfully maintained a high output quality. **Smooth latent space was one of the prominent proper-**\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nties of SOTA GAN works [9, 31–33], while exploring such\\nproperty went through the decade-long GAN research [3,\\n15], whose goals were mainly robust training. Ideas such as\\nWasserstein GAN [4, 17] had proved to be effective, which\\nenforced the Lipschitz continuity on discriminator via gradient penalties. Another technique, namely path length regularization, related to the Jacobian clamping in [51], was\\nadapted in StyleGAN2 [32] and later became a standard setting for GAN-based generators [10, 37, 87, 94]. Benefiting\\nfrom the smoothness property, researchers managed to manipulate latent space in many downstream research projects. Works such as [7, 50, 68, 83] explored latent space disentanglement. GAN-inverse [1, 2, 52, 84] had also proved\\nto be feasible, along with a family of image editing approaches [18, 53, 56, 60, 61, 74, 97]. As aforementioned,\\nour work aims to investigate the latent space smoothness for\\ndiffusion models, which by far remains unexplored. ## 3.', 'search_document: 2022; Hu\\net al. 2023c) has played a significant role in driving these\\nadvancements, prompting further investigations into the understanding of the learned latent space and its potential use\\nfor image editing tasks.

We used the pullback metric\\nto identify the latent and tangent bases in X and H. The latent basis found by the pullback metric\\nallows editing images by traversal along the basis.

To which extent DDMs possess such a convenient\\nlatent space is still a topic of ongoing research. Here we start\\nby reviewing two approaches for defining a latent space in\\nDDMs that facilitate semantic editing. Using DDIM sampling proposed by Song et al. [39],\\nthe generative process is a deterministic mapping from a\\nGaussian noise vector xT ∼N (0, I) to a sampled image x0. In the DDIM framework, the fully noised image xT, can\\nbe regarded as the latent representation. DDIM has the\\nproperty that fixing xT leads to images with similar highlevel features irrespective of the length of the generative\\nprocess. Furthermore, interpolating between two latent codes\\n**x[(1)]T** and x[(2)]T leads to images that vary smoothly between\\nthe two corresponding endpoint images, x[(1)]0 and x[(2)]0 [.]\\n\\n\\nKwon et al. [14] propose h-space for DDMs, the set\\nof bottleneck feature maps of the U-Net [29] across all\\ntimesteps, {hT, . . ., h1} as the latent space. Each bottleneck\\nfeature map ht has a lower spatial dimension but more\\nchannels than the output image. They show that semantics\\ncan be edited by adding offsets ∆ht to the feature maps\\nduring the generative process. To find editing directions, they\\nuse an optimization procedure involving CLIP, where the\\nsemantics to be edited are described by text prompts. The hspace has the following properties: (i) a direction ∆ht has the\\nsame semantic effect on different samples; (ii) the magnitude\\nof ∆ht controls the strength of the edit; (iii) h-space is\\nadditive in the sense that applying a linear combination of\\ndifferent directions where each ∆ht corresponds to a distinct\\nattribute, results in a generated image where all attributes\\nhave been changed. _B.

They have broken the long-time dominance of generative adversarial net**works (GANs) [71] in the challenging task of image synthesis [54, 87, 223, 228] and have**\\nalso shown potential in a variety of domains, ranging from computer vision [2, 11, 19, 23, 88,\\n90, 113, 115, 134, 150, 160, 173, 198, 200, 248, 270, 271, 283, 290], natural language processing [6, 93, 139, 205, 275], temporal data modeling [1, 33, 124, 191, 233, 262], multi-modal modeling [7, 186, 196, 199, 288], robust machine learning [18, 28, 112, 242, 273], to interdisciplinary\\napplications in fields such as computational chemistry [3, 91, 104, 130, 132, 152, 258] and medical\\nimage reconstruction [25, 41–43, 48, 158, 177, 227, 259]. Numerous methods have been developed to improve diffusion models, either by enhancing empirical performance [165, 220, 224] or by extending the model capacity from a theoretical perspective [144, 145, 222, 228, 279]. Over the past two years, the body of research on diffusion models has\\ngrown significantly, making it increasingly challenging for new researchers to stay abreast of the\\nrecent developments in the field. Additionally, the sheer volume of work can obscure major trends\\nand hinder further research progress. This survey aims to address these problems by providing a\\ncomprehensive overview of the state of diffusion model research, categorizing various approaches,\\nand highlighting key advances. In this paper, we first explain the foundations of diffusion models (Section 2), providing a brief\\nbut self-contained introduction to three predominant formulations: denoising diffusion prob**abilistic models (DDPMs) [87, 218], score-based generative models (SGMs) [223, 224], and**\\n**stochastic differential equations (Score SDEs) [111, 222, 228]. Key to all these approaches is**\\nto progressively perturb data with intensifying random noise (called the “diffusion” process), then\\nsuccessively remove noise to generate new data samples. We clarify how they work under the\\nsame principle of diffusion and explain how these three models are connected and can be reduced\\nto one another. Next, we present a taxonomy of recent research that maps out the field of diffusion models,\\ncategorizing it into three key areas: efficient sampling (Section 3), improved likelihood estimation\\n(Section 4), and methods for handling data with special structures (Section 5), such as relational\\ndata, data with permutation/rotational invariance, and data residing on manifolds. We further examine the models by breaking each category into more detailed sub-categories, as illustrated in\\nFigure 1. In addition, we discuss the connections of diffusion models to other deep generative models (Section 6), including variational autoencoders (VAEs) [122, 194], generative adversarial\\n**networks (GANs) [71], normalizing flows [55, 174, 195], autoregressive models [239], and energy-**\\n**based models (EBMs) [129, 226]. By combining these models with diffusion models, researchers**\\nhave the potential to achieve even stronger performance. Following that, our survey reviews six major categories of application that diffusion models have\\nbeen applied to in the existing research (Section 7): computer vision, natural language processing,\\ntemporal data modeling, multi-modal learning, robust learning, and interdisciplinary applications. For each task, we provide a definition, describe how diffusion models can be employed to address\\nit and summarize relevant previous work. We conclude our paper (Sections 8 and 9) by providing\\nan outlook on possible future directions for this exciting new area of research. **2** **FOUNDATIONS OF DIFFUSION MODELS**\\n\\nDiffusion models are a family of probabilistic generative models that progressively destruct data by\\ninjecting noise, then learn to reverse this process for sample generation. We present the intuition\\nof diffusion models in Figure 2. Current research on diffusion models is mostly based on three\\n\\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 56, No.\\n\\n---\\n\\n', 'search_document: 3. Illustrations of works incorporating diffusion models with other generative models, such as : VAE [196]\\nwhere a diffusion model is applied on a latent space, GAN [245] where noise is injected to the discriminator\\ninput, normalizing flow [278] where noise is injected in both forward and backward processes in the flow,\\nautoregressive model [92] where the training objective is similar to diffusion models, and EBM [69] where a\\nsequence of EBMs is learned by diffusion recovery likelihood. DALLE-2 [186] employs a similar strategy by training a diffusion model on the CLIP image embedding space, followed by training a separate decoder to create images based on the CLIP image\\nembeddings. **6** **CONNECTIONS WITH OTHER GENERATIVE MODELS**\\nIn this section, we first introduce five other important classes of generative models and analyze\\ntheir advantages and limitations. Then we introduce how diffusion models are connected with\\nthem, and illustrate how these generative models improve by incorporating diffusion models. We\\nprovide a schematic illustration in Figure 3, and quantitative (with Frechet Inception Distance,\\ndenoted as FID) and qualitative comparisons in Figure 4. **6.1** **Variational Autoencoders and Connections with Diffusion Models**\\nVariational Autoencoders [61, 123, 194] aim to learn both an encoder and a decoder to map input\\ndata to values in a continuous latent space. In these models, the embedding can be interpreted as\\na latent variable in a probabilistic generative model, and a probabilistic decoder can be formulated\\nby a parameterized likelihood function. In addition, the data x is assumed to be generated by some\\nunobserved latent variable z using conditional distribution pθ (x | z), and qϕ (z | x) is used to\\napproximately inference z. To guarantee an effective inference, a variational Bayes approach is\\nused to maximize the evidence lower bound:\\n\\n\\n(40)\\n\\n\\nlog _pθ (x, z) −_ log _qϕ (z | x)_\\n\\n\\nL(ϕ, _θ_ ; x) = Eq (z |x)\\n\\n\\n�\\n\\n\\n�\\n\\n\\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 56, No.', 'search_document: 2022; Hu\\net al. 2023c) has played a significant role in driving these\\nadvancements, prompting further investigations into the understanding of the learned latent space and its potential use\\nfor image editing tasks. While current works perform latent\\nspace editing on the original latent diffusion model setting\\nand architecture (Kwon, Jeong, and Uh 2023; Haas et al. 2023), not much is known about the structure of the latent\\nspace in the most recent advances in the field, specifically\\n\\nCopyright © 2024, Association for the Advancement of Artificial\\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org).

The frequency domain of the local latent basis shifts from low-frequency to high-frequency\\nalong the generative process. We explicitly confirm it using power spectral density analysis. The\\ndifference between local tangent spaces of different samples becomes larger along the generative\\nprocess. The local tangent spaces at various diffusion timesteps are similar to each other if the model\\nis trained on aligned datasets such as CelebA-HQ or Flowers. However, this homogeneity does not\\noccur on complex datasets such as ImageNet. Finally, we examine how the prompts affect the latent structure of text-to-image DMs as follows. Similar prompts yield similar latent structures. Specifically, we find a positive correlation between\\nthe similarity of prompts and the similarity of local tangent spaces. The influence of text on the local\\ntangent space becomes weaker along the generative process. Our work examines the geometry of X and H using Riemannian geometry. We discover the latent\\nstructure of X and how it evolves during the generative process and is influenced by prompts. This\\ngeometric exploration deepens our understanding of DMs. ## 2 Related works\\n\\n**Diffusion Models.** Recent advances in DMs make great progress in the field of image synthesis\\nand show state-of-the-art performance [50, 22, 51]. An important subject in the diffusion model is\\nthe introduction of gradient guidance, including classifier-free guidance, to control the generative\\nprocess [17, 47, 4, 30, 36, 46]. The work by Song et al. [52] has facilitated the unification of DMs\\nwith score-based models using SDEs, enhancing our understanding of DMs as a reverse diffusion\\nprocess. However, the latent space is still largely unexplored, and our understanding is limited. **The study of latent space in GANs.** The study of latent spaces has gained significant attention in\\nrecent years. In the field of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), researchers have proposed\\nvarious methods to manipulate the latent space to achieve the desired effect in the generated images\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n[44, 41, 1, 20, 49, 59, 38]. More recently, several studies [60, 10] have examined the geometrical\\nproperties of latent space in GANs and utilized these findings for image manipulations. These studies\\nbring the advantage of better understanding the characteristics of the latent space and facilitating the\\nanalysis and utilization of GANs. In contrast, the latent space of DMs remains poorly understood,\\nmaking it difficult to fully utilize their capabilities. **Image manipulation in DMs.** Early works include Choi et al. [11] and Meng et al. [33] have\\nattempted to manipulate the resulting images of DMs by replacing latent variables, allowing the\\ngeneration of desired random images. However, due to the lack of semantics in the latent variables of\\nDMs, current approaches have critical problems with semantic image editing. Alternative approaches\\nhave explored the potential of using the feature space within the U-Net for semantic image manipulation. For example, Kwon et al. [26] have shown that the bottleneck of the U-Net, H, can be used as a\\nsemantic latent space. Specifically, they used CLIP [43] to identify directions within H that facilitate\\ngenuine image editing.\\n\\n---\\n\\n', 'search_document: We report more detail about mean and global direction in Appendix L.1. ##### 6 CONCLUSION\\n\\nWe proposed a new generative process, Asyrp, which facilitates image editing in a semantic latent\\nspace h-space for pretrained diffusion models. h-space has nice properties as in the latent space\\nof GANs: homogeneity, linearity, robustness, and consistency across timesteps. The full editing\\nprocess is designed to achieve versatile editing and high quality by measuring editing strength and\\nquality deficiency at timesteps. We hope that our approach and detailed analyses help cultivate a new\\nparadigm of image editing in the semantic latent space of diffusion models. Combining previous\\nfinetuning or guidance techniques would be an interesting research direction.\\n\\n---\\n\\n', 'search_document: RELATED WORK\\n_A. The latent space of diffusion models_\\nGANs have a well-defined latent space suitable for semantic editing. To which extent DDMs possess such a convenient\\nlatent space is still a topic of ongoing research. Here we start\\nby reviewing two approaches for defining a latent space in\\nDDMs that facilitate semantic editing. Using DDIM sampling proposed by Song et al. [39],\\nthe generative process is a deterministic mapping from a\\nGaussian noise vector xT ∼N (0, I) to a sampled image x0. In the DDIM framework, the fully noised image xT, can\\nbe regarded as the latent representation. DDIM has the\\nproperty that fixing xT leads to images with similar highlevel features irrespective of the length of the generative\\nprocess. Furthermore, interpolating between two latent codes\\n**x[(1)]T** and x[(2)]T leads to images that vary smoothly between\\nthe two corresponding endpoint images, x[(1)]0 and x[(2)]0 [.]\\n\\n\\nKwon et al. [14] propose h-space for DDMs, the set\\nof bottleneck feature maps of the U-Net [29] across all\\ntimesteps, {hT, . . ., h1} as the latent space. Each bottleneck\\nfeature map ht has a lower spatial dimension but more\\nchannels than the output image. They show that semantics\\ncan be edited by adding offsets ∆ht to the feature maps\\nduring the generative process. To find editing directions, they\\nuse an optimization procedure involving CLIP, where the\\nsemantics to be edited are described by text prompts. The hspace has the following properties: (i) a direction ∆ht has the\\nsame semantic effect on different samples; (ii) the magnitude\\nof ∆ht controls the strength of the edit; (iii) h-space is\\nadditive in the sense that applying a linear combination of\\ndifferent directions where each ∆ht corresponds to a distinct\\nattribute, results in a generated image where all attributes\\nhave been changed. _B.

      "\n",
      "## I. Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for generative tasks, offering a unique approach to image and data synthesis. These models work by iteratively refining the input noise signal until a realistic output is generated. However, controlling the generation process in diffusion models can be challenging due to the complex and high-dimensional nature of their latent spaces. In this report, we will explore the various ways that the structure of a latent space in a diffusion model can be leveraged to control the generation process.\n",
      "\n",
      "## II. Background: Diffusion Models and Latent Spaces\n",
      "\n",
      "Diffusion models are based on a Markov chain that progressively refines the input noise signal until a realistic output is generated. The latent space in a diffusion model represents the intermediate states of this refinement process, where each state corresponds to a specific level of detail or abstraction. Understanding the properties of latent spaces, such as their dimensionality and structure, is crucial for controlling the generation process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diffusion models can be formulated using stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which provide a mathematical framework for modeling the evolution of the latent space over time. The SDE formulation allows for the derivation of various diffusion-based generative models, including denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and score-based generative models (SGMs).\n",
      "\n",
      "## III. Methods for Leveraging Latent Space Structure\n",
      "\n",
      "Several methods can be employed to leverage the structure of latent spaces in diffusion models:\n",
      "\n",
      "### A. Conditional Generation\n",
      "\n",
      "Conditional generation involves manipulating the latent space to produce specific outputs based on conditioning variables such as class labels or attributes. This can be achieved by modifying the diffusion process to incorporate conditioning information, allowing for targeted control over the generated output.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, conditional generation can be used to generate images of objects with specific attributes, such as color or shape. By manipulating the latent space to produce outputs that match the desired attributes, diffusion models can generate high-quality images that meet specific requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "### B. Latent Space Editing\n",
      "\n",
      "Latent space editing enables targeted changes to generated outputs by identifying and manipulating specific features or attributes in the latent space. Techniques such as optimization-based methods or random walks can be used to explore the latent space and identify the desired edits.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, latent space editing can be used to remove objects from images or to change the color of specific regions. By manipulating the latent space to produce outputs that match the desired edits, diffusion models can generate high-quality images that meet specific requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "### C. Latent Space Exploration\n",
      "\n",
      "Exploring the latent space can help discover new and interesting outputs, which can be achieved through techniques such as random walks or optimization-based methods. This allows for the identification of novel or diverse outputs that may not have been generated otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, latent space exploration can be used to generate new images of objects or scenes that are similar to existing ones but with some variations. By exploring the latent space and identifying new regions of interest, diffusion models can generate high-quality images that meet specific requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "### D. Disentanglement and Factorization\n",
      "\n",
      "Disentanglement and factorization involve separating factors of variation in the latent space, enabling independent control over different attributes or features. Techniques such as VAEs or InfoGANs can be used to learn disentangled representations, which can then be manipulated to achieve specific effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, disentanglement and factorization can be used to separate the style and content of images, allowing for independent control over these factors. By manipulating the latent space to produce outputs that match the desired style or content, diffusion models can generate high-quality images that meet specific requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "### E. Latent Space Regularization\n",
      "\n",
      "Regularization techniques can be applied to the latent space to control generation by penalizing large distances or promoting sparsity. This helps improve mode coverage and reduce artifacts in the generated outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, latent space regularization can be used to prevent mode collapse in diffusion models, where the model generates limited variations of the same output. By applying regularization techniques to the latent space, diffusion models can generate more diverse and high-quality outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "## IV. Applications and Case Studies\n",
      "\n",
      "The methods outlined above have been successfully applied in various applications, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Image generation and editing: Latent space manipulation has been used to achieve impressive results in image editing tasks such as object removal or attribute transfer.\n",
      "* Text-to-image synthesis: Conditional generation has been employed to generate images based on text prompts, demonstrating the potential of diffusion models for text-to-image synthesis.\n",
      "* Data augmentation and generation for downstream tasks: Latent space exploration and editing have been used to generate new training data for downstream tasks such as object detection or segmentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## V. Conclusion and Future Directions\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, leveraging the structure of latent spaces in diffusion models offers a powerful means of controlling the generation process. The methods outlined above provide a range of techniques for achieving targeted control over generated outputs, from conditional generation to latent space editing and exploration.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are still many open research questions and potential future directions, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Improving the efficiency and scalability of latent space manipulation techniques\n",
      "* Developing new applications and use cases for controlled generation\n",
      "* Investigating the theoretical foundations of latent space structure and its relationship to generation quality\n",

In practice, our Smooth Diffusion is trained on top of\\na well-known text-to-image model: Stable Diffusion [62]. We examine and demonstrate that Smooth Diffusion dramatically improves the latent space smoothness over its\\nbaseline. Meanwhile, we conduct extensive research across\\nnumerous downstream tasks, including but not limited to\\nimage interpolation, inversion, editing, etc. Both qualitative\\nand quantitative results support our conclusion that Smooth\\nDiffusion can be the next-gen high-performing generative\\nmodel not only for the baseline text-to-image task but across\\nvarious downstream tasks. ## 2. Related Work\\n\\n**Diffusion models are initiated from a family of prior works**\\nincluding but not limited to [8, 66, 70, 76]. Since then,\\nDDPM [24] introduced an image-based noise prediction\\nmodel, becoming one of the most popular image generation\\nresearch. Later works [12, 48, 71] extended DDPM, demonstrating that diffusion models perform on-par and even surpass GAN-based methods [15, 30–33]. Recently, generating images from text prompts (T2I) become an emerging field [11, 19, 28, 47, 62], among which diffusion models [16, 49, 59, 62, 64] have become quite visible to the\\npublic. For example, Stable Diffusion (SD) [62] consists of\\nVAE [36] and CLIP [58], diffuses latent space, and yields an\\noutstanding balance between quality and speed. Following\\nSD [62], researchers also explored diffusion approaches for\\ncontrols such as ControlNet [14, 26, 46, 57, 80, 85, 86, 89–\\n91, 95] and multimodal such as Versatile Diffusion [6, 41,\\n73, 88]. Works from a different track reduce diffusion steps\\nto improve speed [5, 34, 39, 43, 65, 72, 92, 96], or restrict\\ndata and domain for few-shot learning [20, 25, 40, 63], all\\nhad successfully maintained a high output quality. **Smooth latent space was one of the prominent proper-**\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nties of SOTA GAN works [9, 31–33], while exploring such\\nproperty went through the decade-long GAN research [3,\\n15], whose goals were mainly robust training. Ideas such as\\nWasserstein GAN [4, 17] had proved to be effective, which\\nenforced the Lipschitz continuity on discriminator via gradient penalties. Another technique, namely path length regularization, related to the Jacobian clamping in [51], was\\nadapted in StyleGAN2 [32] and later became a standard setting for GAN-based generators [10, 37, 87, 94]. Benefiting\\nfrom the smoothness property, researchers managed to manipulate latent space in many downstream research projects. Works such as [7, 50, 68, 83] explored latent space disentanglement. GAN-inverse [1, 2, 52, 84] had also proved\\nto be feasible, along with a family of image editing approaches [18, 53, 56, 60, 61, 74, 97]. As aforementioned,\\nour work aims to investigate the latent space smoothness for\\ndiffusion models, which by far remains unexplored. ## 3.', 'search_document: 2022; Hu\\net al. 2023c) has played a significant role in driving these\\nadvancements, prompting further investigations into the understanding of the learned latent space and its potential use\\nfor image editing tasks.

We used the pullback metric\\nto identify the latent and tangent bases in X and H. The latent basis found by the pullback metric\\nallows editing images by traversal along the basis. We have observed properties of the bases in two\\naspects.

The diffusion process follows the standard\\nformulation in DDPM [21] that consists of a forward diffusion and a backward denoising process. Given a data sample x ∼ _p(x), an autoencoder consisting an encoder E and_\\na decoder D first project the x into latent z via z = E(x). Then, the diffusion and denoising process are conducted\\nin the latent space. Once the denoising is completed at\\ntimestep 0, the sample will be decoded via x = D( ˜z0). The\\nforward diffusion is a fixed Markov process of T timesteps\\nthat yields latent variables zt based on the latent variable at\\nprevious timestep zt−1 via\\n\\n_q(zt|zt−1) = N_ (zt; �1 − _βtzt−1, βtI),_ (1)\\n\\nwhere βt is a predefined variance at each step t.

Yang et al. **1** **INTRODUCTION**\\n\\nDiffusion models [87, 218, 223, 228] have emerged as the new state-of-the-art family of deep\\ngenerative models. They have broken the long-time dominance of generative adversarial net**works (GANs) [71] in the challenging task of image synthesis [54, 87, 223, 228] and have**\\nalso shown potential in a variety of domains, ranging from computer vision [2, 11, 19, 23, 88,\\n90, 113, 115, 134, 150, 160, 173, 198, 200, 248, 270, 271, 283, 290], natural language processing [6, 93, 139, 205, 275], temporal data modeling [1, 33, 124, 191, 233, 262], multi-modal modeling [7, 186, 196, 199, 288], robust machine learning [18, 28, 112, 242, 273], to interdisciplinary\\napplications in fields such as computational chemistry [3, 91, 104, 130, 132, 152, 258] and medical\\nimage reconstruction [25, 41–43, 48, 158, 177, 227, 259]. Numerous methods have been developed to improve diffusion models, either by enhancing empirical performance [165, 220, 224] or by extending the model capacity from a theoretical perspective [144, 145, 222, 228, 279]. Over the past two years, the body of research on diffusion models has\\ngrown significantly, making it increasingly challenging for new researchers to stay abreast of the\\nrecent developments in the field. Additionally, the sheer volume of work can obscure major trends\\nand hinder further research progress. This survey aims to address these problems by providing a\\ncomprehensive overview of the state of diffusion model research, categorizing various approaches,\\nand highlighting key advances. In this paper, we first explain the foundations of diffusion models (Section 2), providing a brief\\nbut self-contained introduction to three predominant formulations: denoising diffusion prob**abilistic models (DDPMs) [87, 218], score-based generative models (SGMs) [223, 224], and**\\n**stochastic differential equations (Score SDEs) [111, 222, 228]. Key to all these approaches is**\\nto progressively perturb data with intensifying random noise (called the “diffusion” process), then\\nsuccessively remove noise to generate new data samples. We clarify how they work under the\\nsame principle of diffusion and explain how these three models are connected and can be reduced\\nto one another. Next, we present a taxonomy of recent research that maps out the field of diffusion models,\\ncategorizing it into three key areas: efficient sampling (Section 3), improved likelihood estimation\\n(Section 4), and methods for handling data with special structures (Section 5), such as relational\\ndata, data with permutation/rotational invariance, and data residing on manifolds. We further examine the models by breaking each category into more detailed sub-categories, as illustrated in\\nFigure 1. In addition, we discuss the connections of diffusion models to other deep generative models (Section 6), including variational autoencoders (VAEs) [122, 194], generative adversarial\\n**networks (GANs) [71], normalizing flows [55, 174, 195], autoregressive models [239], and energy-**\\n**based models (EBMs) [129, 226]. By combining these models with diffusion models, researchers**\\nhave the potential to achieve even stronger performance. Following that, our survey reviews six major categories of application that diffusion models have\\nbeen applied to in the existing research (Section 7): computer vision, natural language processing,\\ntemporal data modeling, multi-modal learning, robust learning, and interdisciplinary applications. For each task, we provide a definition, describe how diffusion models can be employed to address\\nit and summarize relevant previous work. We conclude our paper (Sections 8 and 9) by providing\\nan outlook on possible future directions for this exciting new area of research. **2** **FOUNDATIONS OF DIFFUSION MODELS**\\n\\nDiffusion models are a family of probabilistic generative models that progressively destruct data by\\ninjecting noise, then learn to reverse this process for sample generation. We present the intuition\\nof diffusion models in Figure 2.

Illustrations of works incorporating diffusion models with other generative models, such as : VAE [196]\\nwhere a diffusion model is applied on a latent space, GAN [245] where noise is injected to the discriminator\\ninput, normalizing flow [278] where noise is injected in both forward and backward processes in the flow,\\nautoregressive model [92] where the training objective is similar to diffusion models, and EBM [69] where a\\nsequence of EBMs is learned by diffusion recovery likelihood. DALLE-2 [186] employs a similar strategy by training a diffusion model on the CLIP image embedding space, followed by training a separate decoder to create images based on the CLIP image\\nembeddings. **6** **CONNECTIONS WITH OTHER GENERATIVE MODELS**\\nIn this section, we first introduce five other important classes of generative models and analyze\\ntheir advantages and limitations. Then we introduce how diffusion models are connected with\\nthem, and illustrate how these generative models improve by incorporating diffusion models. We\\nprovide a schematic illustration in Figure 3, and quantitative (with Frechet Inception Distance,\\ndenoted as FID) and qualitative comparisons in Figure 4. **6.1** **Variational Autoencoders and Connections with Diffusion Models**\\nVariational Autoencoders [61, 123, 194] aim to learn both an encoder and a decoder to map input\\ndata to values in a continuous latent space. In these models, the embedding can be interpreted as\\na latent variable in a probabilistic generative model, and a probabilistic decoder can be formulated\\nby a parameterized likelihood function. In addition, the data x is assumed to be generated by some\\nunobserved latent variable z using conditional distribution pθ (x | z), and qϕ (z | x) is used to\\napproximately inference z.

The frequency domain of the local latent basis shifts from low-frequency to high-frequency\\nalong the generative process. We explicitly confirm it using power spectral density analysis. The\\ndifference between local tangent spaces of different samples becomes larger along the generative\\nprocess. The local tangent spaces at various diffusion timesteps are similar to each other if the model\\nis trained on aligned datasets such as CelebA-HQ or Flowers. However, this homogeneity does not\\noccur on complex datasets such as ImageNet. Finally, we examine how the prompts affect the latent structure of text-to-image DMs as follows. Similar prompts yield similar latent structures. Specifically, we find a positive correlation between\\nthe similarity of prompts and the similarity of local tangent spaces. The influence of text on the local\\ntangent space becomes weaker along the generative process. Our work examines the geometry of X and H using Riemannian geometry. We discover the latent\\nstructure of X and how it evolves during the generative process and is influenced by prompts. This\\ngeometric exploration deepens our understanding of DMs. ## 2 Related works\\n\\n**Diffusion Models.** Recent advances in DMs make great progress in the field of image synthesis\\nand show state-of-the-art performance [50, 22, 51]. An important subject in the diffusion model is\\nthe introduction of gradient guidance, including classifier-free guidance, to control the generative\\nprocess [17, 47, 4, 30, 36, 46]. The work by Song et al. [52] has facilitated the unification of DMs\\nwith score-based models using SDEs, enhancing our understanding of DMs as a reverse diffusion\\nprocess. However, the latent space is still largely unexplored, and our understanding is limited. **The study of latent space in GANs.** The study of latent spaces has gained significant attention in\\nrecent years. In the field of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), researchers have proposed\\nvarious methods to manipulate the latent space to achieve the desired effect in the generated images\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n[44, 41, 1, 20, 49, 59, 38]. More recently, several studies [60, 10] have examined the geometrical\\nproperties of latent space in GANs and utilized these findings for image manipulations. These studies\\nbring the advantage of better understanding the characteristics of the latent space and facilitating the\\nanalysis and utilization of GANs. In contrast, the latent space of DMs remains poorly understood,\\nmaking it difficult to fully utilize their capabilities. **Image manipulation in DMs.** Early works include Choi et al. [11] and Meng et al. [33] have\\nattempted to manipulate the resulting images of DMs by replacing latent variables, allowing the\\ngeneration of desired random images. However, due to the lack of semantics in the latent variables of\\nDMs, current approaches have critical problems with semantic image editing. Alternative approaches\\nhave explored the potential of using the feature space within the U-Net for semantic image manipulation. For example, Kwon et al.

The latent space of diffusion models_\\nGANs have a well-defined latent space suitable for semantic editing. To which extent DDMs possess such a convenient\\nlatent space is still a topic of ongoing research. Here we start\\nby reviewing two approaches for defining a latent space in\\nDDMs that facilitate semantic editing. Using DDIM sampling proposed by Song et al. [39],\\nthe generative process is a deterministic mapping from a\\nGaussian noise vector xT ∼N (0, I) to a sampled image x0. In the DDIM framework, the fully noised image xT, can\\nbe regarded as the latent representation. DDIM has the\\nproperty that fixing xT leads to images with similar highlevel features irrespective of the length of the generative\\nprocess. Furthermore, interpolating between two latent codes\\n**x[(1)]T** and x[(2)]T leads to images that vary smoothly between\\nthe two corresponding endpoint images, x[(1)]0 and x[(2)]0 [.]\\n\\n\\nKwon et al. [14] propose h-space for DDMs, the set\\nof bottleneck feature maps of the U-Net [29] across all\\ntimesteps, {hT, . . ., h1} as the latent space. Each bottleneck\\nfeature map ht has a lower spatial dimension but more\\nchannels than the output image. They show that semantics\\ncan be edited by adding offsets ∆ht to the feature maps\\nduring the generative process. To find editing directions, they\\nuse an optimization procedure involving CLIP, where the\\nsemantics to be edited are described by text prompts. The hspace has the following properties: (i) a direction ∆ht has the\\nsame semantic effect on different samples; (ii) the magnitude\\nof ∆ht controls the strength of the edit; (iii) h-space is\\nadditive in the sense that applying a linear combination of\\ndifferent directions where each ∆ht corresponds to a distinct\\nattribute, results in a generated image where all attributes\\nhave been changed. _B.

One solution is to inject noise into the discriminator input for widening the support of both the\\ngenerator and discriminator distributions. Taking advantage of the flexible diffusion model, Wang\\net al. (2022) [245] inject noise to the discriminator with an adaptive noise schedule determined by\\na diffusion model. On the other hand, GAN can facilitate sampling speed of diffusion models. Xiao\\net al. (2021) [256] show that slow sampling is caused by the Gaussian assumption in the denoising\\nstep, which is justified only for small step sizes. As such, each denoising step is modeled by a\\nconditional GAN, allowing larger step size. **6.3** **Normalizing Flows and Connections with Diffusion Models**\\n\\nNormalizing flows [56, 193] are generative models that generate tractable distributions to model\\nhigh-dimensional data [57, 121]. Normalizing flows can transform simple probability distribution\\ninto an extremely complex probability distribution, which can be used in generative models, reinforcement learning, variational inference, and other fields. Existing normalizing flows are constructed based on the change of variable formula [56, 193]. The trajectory in normalizing flows\\nis formulated by a differential equation. In the discrete-time setting, the mapping from data x\\nto latent z in normalizing flows is a composition of a sequence of bijections, taking the form of\\n_F = FN ◦_ _FN −1 ◦_ . .\\n\\n---\\n\\n', 'search_document: 2). Second, the parameters\\nlearned from modifying one image should transfer well to\\nother similar images. For example, the optimal parameters\\nthat can add smile to one person should also work for images of different people with different genders and races. Previous studies have discovered that GANs are inherently endowed with a strong disentanglement capability. Specifically, it is found that there exist certain directions in\\nthe latent space separately controlling different attributes. Therefore, by identifying these directions, e.g., via principal component analysis [19], GAN can achieve effective\\ndisentanglement without any re-training or fine-tuning. On\\nthe other hand, such an inherent disentanglement capability has yet to be found in diffusion models. Hence come\\nour research questions: Do diffusion models also possess\\na disentanglement capability with the aforementioned nice\\nproperties? If so, how can we uncover it?\\n\\nIn this paper, we seek to answer these research questions. Our finding is that for stable diffusion model [61], one of the\\ndiffusion models that can generate images based on an input text description, disentangled image modifications can\\nbe achieved by partial modifications in the text embedding\\nspace. In particular, if we fix the standard Gaussian noises\\nintroduced in the denoising process, and partially change\\nthe input text embedding from a neutral description (e.g., “a\\nphoto of person”) to one with style (e.g., “a photo of person\\nwith smile”), the generated image will also shift towards the\\ntarget style without changing the semantic content. Based\\non this finding, we further propose a simple, light-weight al\\n\\ngorithm, where we optimize the mixing weights of the two\\ntext embeddings under two objectives, a perceptual loss for\\ncontent preservation and a CLIP-based style matching loss. The entire process only involves optimizing over around 50\\nparameters and does not fine-tune the diffusion model. Our experiments show that the inherent disentanglement\\ncapability in stable diffusion model can already disentangle a wide range of concepts and attributes, ranging from\\nglobal styles such as painting styles to local styles like facial expressions, as shown in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 1,\\nby learning the optimal mixing weights of the two descriptions, stable diffusion models can generate convincing image pairs that only modify the target attribute, and\\nthe optimal weights can generalize well to different images. The experiment results also show that our proposed\\nimage editing algorithm, without fine-tuning the diffusion\\nmodel, can match or outperform the more sophisticated\\ndiffusion-model-based image-editing baselines that require\\nfine-tuning. The findings of this paper can shed some light\\non how diffusion models work and how they can be applied\\nto image editing tasks. ## 2. Related Works\\n\\n**Disentanglement in Generative Models:** The ability to\\ndisentangle different attributes is a key desired property of\\ngenerative models. Previous work that studies disentanglement mainly aims to learn parameters that allow modifications on a target aspect without changing other aspects, and the learned parameters should generalize to different images [3, 15, 32]. For pre-trained GANs [10, 31–\\n33], it has been shown that the disentanglement can be\\nachieved by moving towards particular directions in its latent space [19, 68–70], which will lead to attribute-only\\nchanges [1, 2, 53]. Multiple methods have been proposed\\nto discover these latent directions, which leverage auxiliary\\nclassifiers [68,69], principal component analysis [19], contrastive learning [58], and information maximization [12]. Besides GANs, disentanglement has also been studied in\\nVAE and flow-based models [36, 52]. Recently, two works\\nstudy disentanglement in diffusion models. The first work\\ndisentangles attributes by learning a shift in the embedding\\nspace of an intermediate layer of U-Net [41, 62], such that\\napplying the shift satisfies the disentanglement criteria. Par\\n\\n-----\\n\\nticularly, they use a neural network to generate such shifts. However, disentangling in the hidden layer representation\\nof U-Net might be sub-optimal, as can be observed that their\\nmethod struggles at disentangling holistic styles of the image. Moreover, their search space and number of parameters are much larger than ours. By contrast, we consider\\nthe text embedding space, which is more natural for text-toimage diffusion models and achieves comparable or better\\nresults with only 1.2% parameters of theirs. Another work\\nthat studies disentanglement is [54]. They train an encoder\\nto generate an image-specific representation, which is later\\nused as input to diffusion models to reconstruct the original image. Disentanglement is done by finding corresponding directions in this representation space similar to methods in GANs [68, 69]. However, their method requires retraining a diffusion model from scratch, whereas we fix the\\npre-trained diffusion model. **Diffusion Models: Diffusion models [23,71–73] are a fam-**\\nily of generative models that have achieved state-of-the-art\\nperformance in image synthesis and have advanced research\\nin super-resolution [24, 66], inpainting [49, 64], density estimation [38], video synthesis [22, 26], and areas beyond\\ncomputer vision [6, 11, 27, 40, 74]. Building on top of diffusion models, various methods have been proposed to control\\nthe generation process through external models [14, 46] or\\nadditional inputs [25]. One type of conditional generation\\nmodels is the text-to-image diffusion models [51,56,61,65],\\nwhich take text descriptions as inputs and generate images\\nthat match the text descriptions. Due to the expressiveness\\nof text and superior generation quality of diffusion models,\\nthese models allow unprecedented control over generated\\nimages and have inspired many novel applications. **Image Editing:** Image editing is a widely-studied task\\n\\n[21, 77]. Many GAN-based editing works [9, 28, 42, 47, 53]\\nhave demonstrated strong controllability. Recently, diffusion models have been broadly adapted to image editing\\ntask [13, 20, 43, 45, 50]. With the CLIP encoder [55] that\\nbridges text and image, generation process can be guided\\nby arbitrary text descriptions [46]. To preserve the contents\\nin a local region, [8] relies on an auxiliary mask, such that\\ncontents in the unmasked region are largely kept unchanged\\nduring generation. Moreover, some works [16, 34, 63] propose to invert the input image to find text embeddings that\\ncan synthesize the same object but in different scenes and\\nviews.

In practice, our Smooth Diffusion is trained on top of\\na well-known text-to-image model: Stable Diffusion [62]. We examine and demonstrate that Smooth Diffusion dramatically improves the latent space smoothness over its\\nbaseline. Meanwhile, we conduct extensive research across\\nnumerous downstream tasks, including but not limited to\\nimage interpolation, inversion, editing, etc. Both qualitative\\nand quantitative results support our conclusion that Smooth\\nDiffusion can be the next-gen high-performing generative\\nmodel not only for the baseline text-to-image task but across\\nvarious downstream tasks. ## 2. Related Work\\n\\n**Diffusion models are initiated from a family of prior works**\\nincluding but not limited to [8, 66, 70, 76]. Since then,\\nDDPM [24] introduced an image-based noise prediction\\nmodel, becoming one of the most popular image generation\\nresearch. Later works [12, 48, 71] extended DDPM, demonstrating that diffusion models perform on-par and even surpass GAN-based methods [15, 30–33]. Recently, generating images from text prompts (T2I) become an emerging field [11, 19, 28, 47, 62], among which diffusion models [16, 49, 59, 62, 64] have become quite visible to the\\npublic. For example, Stable Diffusion (SD) [62] consists of\\nVAE [36] and CLIP [58], diffuses latent space, and yields an\\noutstanding balance between quality and speed. Following\\nSD [62], researchers also explored diffusion approaches for\\ncontrols such as ControlNet [14, 26, 46, 57, 80, 85, 86, 89–\\n91, 95] and multimodal such as Versatile Diffusion [6, 41,\\n73, 88]. Works from a different track reduce diffusion steps\\nto improve speed [5, 34, 39, 43, 65, 72, 92, 96], or restrict\\ndata and domain for few-shot learning [20, 25, 40, 63], all\\nhad successfully maintained a high output quality. **Smooth latent space was one of the prominent proper-**\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nties of SOTA GAN works [9, 31–33], while exploring such\\nproperty went through the decade-long GAN research [3,\\n15], whose goals were mainly robust training. Ideas such as\\nWasserstein GAN [4, 17] had proved to be effective, which\\nenforced the Lipschitz continuity on discriminator via gradient penalties. Another technique, namely path length regularization, related to the Jacobian clamping in [51], was\\nadapted in StyleGAN2 [32] and later became a standard setting for GAN-based generators [10, 37, 87, 94]. Benefiting\\nfrom the smoothness property, researchers managed to manipulate latent space in many downstream research projects. Works such as [7, 50, 68, 83] explored latent space disentanglement. GAN-inverse [1, 2, 52, 84] had also proved\\nto be feasible, along with a family of image editing approaches [18, 53, 56, 60, 61, 74, 97]. As aforementioned,\\nour work aims to investigate the latent space smoothness for\\ndiffusion models, which by far remains unexplored. ## 3.\\n\\n---\\n\\n', 'search_document: See samples in Figure 9 (Appendix G). _2D GAN_ _3D GAN_ _Diffusion model_\\n\\nStyleGAN2 StyleGAN-XL GIRAFFE-HD EG3D LDM-DDIM (η = 0) DDGAN DiffAE\\n\\nID-A 0.561 0.681 0.616 0.468 **0.904** 0.837 0.873\\nID-B 0.604 0.688 0.590 0.454 **0.896** 0.805 0.838\\nID-C 0.495 0.636 0.457 0.403 **0.892** 0.795 0.852\\nID-D 0.554 0.687 0.574 0.436 **0.911** 0.831 0.873\\n\\n#### 5 CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION\\n\\nThis paper provides a unified view of pre-trained generative models by reformulating the latent space\\nof diffusion models. While this reformulation is purely definitional, we show that it allows us to use\\ndiffusion models in similar ways as CycleGANs (Zhu et al., 2017) and GANs. Our CycleDiffusion\\nachieves impressive performance on unpaired image-to-image translation (with two diffusion models\\ntrained on two domains independently) and zero-shot image-to-image translation (with text-to-image\\ndiffusion models). Our definition of latent code also allows diffusion models to be guided in the\\nsame way as GANs (i.e., plug-and-play, without finetuning on noisy images), and results show that\\ndiffusion models have broader coverage of sub-populations and individuals than GANs. Besides the interesting results, it is worth noting that this paper raised more questions than provided\\nanswers. We have provided a formal analysis of the common latent space of stochastic DPMs via the\\nbounded distance between images (Section 3.3), but it still needs further study. Notably, Khrulkov\\n& Oseledets (2022) and Su et al. (2022) studied deterministic DPMs based on optimal transport. Furthermore, efficient plug-and-play guidance for stochastic DPMs on high-resolution images with\\nmany diffusion steps still remains open. These topics can be further explored in future studies.\\n\\n---\\n\\n', 'search_document: We report more detail about mean and global direction in Appendix L.1. ##### 6 CONCLUSION\\n\\nWe proposed a new generative process, Asyrp, which facilitates image editing in a semantic latent\\nspace h-space for pretrained diffusion models. h-space has nice properties as in the latent space\\nof GANs: homogeneity, linearity, robustness, and consistency across timesteps.

Latent Space Navigation\\n\\nRecently, several strategies have been proposed to manipulate the latent structure of pre-trained GANs. These\\nmethods manipulate images in different ways by editing the\\nlatent code and can be divided into two groups. **Supervised Setting.** Supervised approaches typically use\\npre-trained classifiers to guide optimization-based learning\\nto discover interpretable directions that specifically manipulate the properties of interest. InterfaceGAN [26] is a supervised approach that benefits from labeled data including\\n_gender, facial expression and age. It trains binary Support_\\nVector Machines (SVM) [19] on each label and interprets\\nthe normal vectors of the obtained hyperplanes as latent directions. GANalyze [6] finds directions for cognitive image\\nproperties for a pre-trained BigGAN model using an externally trained assessor function. Feedback from the assessor\\nguides the optimization process, and the resulting optimal\\ndirection allows manipulation of the desired cognitive attributes. StyleFlow [1] uses attribute-conditioned continuous normalizing flows that use labels to find edit directions\\nin the latent space of GANs. **Unsupervised Setting.** One of the unsupervised works\\nproposed by [33] discovers meaningful directions using a\\nclassifier-based approach. Given a particular manipulation,\\nthe classifier tries to detect which particular direction is applied. At the end of the optimization process, the method\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nFigure 2: Illustration of LatentCLR. First, each latent code is passed through direction models (denoted with Dk) and up to\\na target feature layer of the GAN (denoted with Gf ) to obtain intermediate representations of edited codes. Then, the effects\\nof direction models are computed by subtracting the representation of the original latent code. Finally, pairs produced by the\\nsame model are considered as positive, and others as negative, in a contrastive loss. learns disentangled directions. Ganspace [9] is a sampling\\nbased unsupervised method where latent vectors are randomly selected from the intermediate layers of BigGAN\\nand StyleGAN models. Then they propose to use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [36] to find principal components that are interpreted as semantically meaningful directions. The principal components lead to a variety of\\nuseful manipulations, including zoom, rotation in BigGAN\\nor changing gender, hair color, or age in StyleGAN models. SeFa [27] follows a related approach, using a closedform solution that specifically optimizes the intermediate\\nweight matrix of the pre-trained GAN model. They obtain interpretable directions in the latent space by computing the eigenvectors of the first projection matrix and selecting the eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalues. A different closed-form solution is proposed by [29] that discovers directions without optimization.\\n\\n---\\n\\n', 'search_document: ## 5. Limitations\\n\\nOur method uses a pre-trained GAN model as input, so\\nit is limited to manipulating GAN-generated images only. However, it can be extended to real images by using GAN\\ninversion methods [40] by encoding the real images into the\\nlatent space. Like any image synthesis tool, our method also\\nposes similar concerns and dangers in terms of misuse, as\\nit can be applied to images of people or faces for malicious\\npurposes, as discussed in [14].\\n\\n---\\n\\n', 'search_document: ## 2. Related Work\\n\\nIn this section, we introduce generative adversarial networks and discuss latent space manipulation methods. ### 2.1. Generative Adversarial Networks\\n\\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of a\\ngenerator and a discriminator for mapping the real world to\\nthe generative space [7]. The discriminator part of the network tries to detect whether images are from the training\\ndataset or synthetic, while the generative part tries to generate images that are similar to the dataset. StyleGAN [11]\\nand StyleGAN2 are among the popular GAN approaches\\nthat are capable of generating high-quality images. They\\nuse a mapping network consisting of an 8-layer perceptron\\nthat aims to map the input latent code to an intermediate\\nlatent space. Another popular GAN model is BigGAN [2],\\na large-scale model trained on ImageNet. Similar to StyleGAN2, it also makes use of intermediate layers by using the\\nlatent vector as input, also called skip-z inputs, as well as a\\nclass vector. Due to its conditional architecture, it can generate images in a variety of categories from ImageNet. In\\nthis paper, we work with pre-trained StyleGAN2 and BigGAN models.\\n\\n---\\n\\n', 'search_document: (2021) [95], and Kingma et al. (2021) [120] demonstrate that the score matching objective may be approximated by the Evidence\\n**Lower Bound (ELBO) of a deep hierarchical VAE. Consequently, optimizing a diffusion model can**\\nbe seen as training an infinitely deep hierarchical VAE—a finding that supports the common belief\\nthat Score SDE diffusion models can be interpreted as the continuous limit of hierarchical VAEs. The Latent Score-Based Generative Model (LSGM) [238] furthers this line of research by illustrating that the ELBO can be considered a specialized score matching objective in the context of\\nlatent space diffusion. Though the cross-entropy term in the ELBO is intractable, it can be transformed into a tractable score matching objective by viewing the score-based generative model as\\nan infinitely deep VAE. **6.2** **Generative Adversarial Networks and Connections with Diffusion Models**\\n\\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [45, 71, 79] mainly consist of two models: a generator G\\nand a discriminator D. These two models are typically constructed by neural networks but could\\nbe implemented in any form of a differentiable system that maps input data from one space to\\nanother. The optimization of GANs can be viewed as a minimax optimization problem with value\\nfunction V (G, D):\\n\\nmin (41)\\n\\n_G_ [max]D [E][x][∼][p][data] [(][x][)][[log][ D] [(][x][)][]][ +][ E][z][∼][p][z] [(][z][)][[log][(][1][ −] _[D][(][G]_ [(][z][)))][]][.]\\n\\n\\nThe generator G aims to generate new examples and implicitly model the data distribution. The\\ndiscriminator D is usually a binary classifier that is used to identify generated examples from true\\nexamples with maximally possible accuracy. The optimization process ends at a saddle point that\\nproduces a minimum about the generator and a maximum about the discriminator. Namely, the\\ngoal of GAN optimization is to achieve Nash equilibrium [192]. At that point, the generator can\\nbe considered that it has captured the accurate distribution of real examples. One of the issues of GAN is the instability in the training process, which is mainly caused\\nby the non-overlapping between the distribution of input data and that of the generated data.

In Section 3.1, we review the preliminaries on diffusion\\nmodels, and introduce our approach for injecting guidance\\nfor controllable image synthesis. In Section 3.2, we describe the language guidance which enables the unconditional diffusion model to perform text-to-image synthesis. In Section 3.3, we propose two types of image guidance,\\nwhich take the content and style information from the reference image as the guidance signal, respectively.

In practice, our Smooth Diffusion is trained on top of\\na well-known text-to-image model: Stable Diffusion [62]. We examine and demonstrate that Smooth Diffusion dramatically improves the latent space smoothness over its\\nbaseline.

Related Work\\n\\n**Diffusion models are initiated from a family of prior works**\\nincluding but not limited to [8, 66, 70, 76]. Since then,\\nDDPM [24] introduced an image-based noise prediction\\nmodel, becoming one of the most popular image generation\\nresearch. Later works [12, 48, 71] extended DDPM, demonstrating that diffusion models perform on-par and even surpass GAN-based methods [15, 30–33]. Recently, generating images from text prompts (T2I) become an emerging field [11, 19, 28, 47, 62], among which diffusion models [16, 49, 59, 62, 64] have become quite visible to the\\npublic. For example, Stable Diffusion (SD) [62] consists of\\nVAE [36] and CLIP [58], diffuses latent space, and yields an\\noutstanding balance between quality and speed. Following\\nSD [62], researchers also explored diffusion approaches for\\ncontrols such as ControlNet [14, 26, 46, 57, 80, 85, 86, 89–\\n91, 95] and multimodal such as Versatile Diffusion [6, 41,\\n73, 88]. Works from a different track reduce diffusion steps\\nto improve speed [5, 34, 39, 43, 65, 72, 92, 96], or restrict\\ndata and domain for few-shot learning [20, 25, 40, 63], all\\nhad successfully maintained a high output quality. **Smooth latent space was one of the prominent proper-**\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nties of SOTA GAN works [9, 31–33], while exploring such\\nproperty went through the decade-long GAN research [3,\\n15], whose goals were mainly robust training. Ideas such as\\nWasserstein GAN [4, 17] had proved to be effective, which\\nenforced the Lipschitz continuity on discriminator via gradient penalties. Another technique, namely path length regularization, related to the Jacobian clamping in [51], was\\nadapted in StyleGAN2 [32] and later became a standard setting for GAN-based generators [10, 37, 87, 94]. Benefiting\\nfrom the smoothness property, researchers managed to manipulate latent space in many downstream research projects. Works such as [7, 50, 68, 83] explored latent space disentanglement. GAN-inverse [1, 2, 52, 84] had also proved\\nto be feasible, along with a family of image editing approaches [18, 53, 56, 60, 61, 74, 97].

Our CycleDiffusion\\nachieves impressive performance on unpaired image-to-image translation (with two diffusion models\\ntrained on two domains independently) and zero-shot image-to-image translation (with text-to-image\\ndiffusion models). Our definition of latent code also allows diffusion models to be guided in the\\nsame way as GANs (i.e., plug-and-play, without finetuning on noisy images), and results show that\\ndiffusion models have broader coverage of sub-populations and individuals than GANs. Besides the interesting results, it is worth noting that this paper raised more questions than provided\\nanswers. We have provided a formal analysis of the common latent space of stochastic DPMs via the\\nbounded distance between images (Section 3.3), but it still needs further study. Notably, Khrulkov\\n& Oseledets (2022) and Su et al. (2022) studied deterministic DPMs based on optimal transport. Furthermore, efficient plug-and-play guidance for stochastic DPMs on high-resolution images with\\nmany diffusion steps still remains open. These topics can be further explored in future studies.\\n\\n---\\n\\n', 'search_document: We report more detail about mean and global direction in Appendix L.1. ##### 6 CONCLUSION\\n\\nWe proposed a new generative process, Asyrp, which facilitates image editing in a semantic latent\\nspace h-space for pretrained diffusion models. h-space has nice properties as in the latent space\\nof GANs: homogeneity, linearity, robustness, and consistency across timesteps.

Yang et al. **1** **INTRODUCTION**\\n\\nDiffusion models [87, 218, 223, 228] have emerged as the new state-of-the-art family of deep\\ngenerative models. They have broken the long-time dominance of generative adversarial net**works (GANs) [71] in the challenging task of image synthesis [54, 87, 223, 228] and have**\\nalso shown potential in a variety of domains, ranging from computer vision [2, 11, 19, 23, 88,\\n90, 113, 115, 134, 150, 160, 173, 198, 200, 248, 270, 271, 283, 290], natural language processing [6, 93, 139, 205, 275], temporal data modeling [1, 33, 124, 191, 233, 262], multi-modal modeling [7, 186, 196, 199, 288], robust machine learning [18, 28, 112, 242, 273], to interdisciplinary\\napplications in fields such as computational chemistry [3, 91, 104, 130, 132, 152, 258] and medical\\nimage reconstruction [25, 41–43, 48, 158, 177, 227, 259]. Numerous methods have been developed to improve diffusion models, either by enhancing empirical performance [165, 220, 224] or by extending the model capacity from a theoretical perspective [144, 145, 222, 228, 279]. Over the past two years, the body of research on diffusion models has\\ngrown significantly, making it increasingly challenging for new researchers to stay abreast of the\\nrecent developments in the field. Additionally, the sheer volume of work can obscure major trends\\nand hinder further research progress. This survey aims to address these problems by providing a\\ncomprehensive overview of the state of diffusion model research, categorizing various approaches,\\nand highlighting key advances. In this paper, we first explain the foundations of diffusion models (Section 2), providing a brief\\nbut self-contained introduction to three predominant formulations: denoising diffusion prob**abilistic models (DDPMs) [87, 218], score-based generative models (SGMs) [223, 224], and**\\n**stochastic differential equations (Score SDEs) [111, 222, 228]. Key to all these approaches is**\\nto progressively perturb data with intensifying random noise (called the “diffusion” process), then\\nsuccessively remove noise to generate new data samples. We clarify how they work under the\\nsame principle of diffusion and explain how these three models are connected and can be reduced\\nto one another. Next, we present a taxonomy of recent research that maps out the field of diffusion models,\\ncategorizing it into three key areas: efficient sampling (Section 3), improved likelihood estimation\\n(Section 4), and methods for handling data with special structures (Section 5), such as relational\\ndata, data with permutation/rotational invariance, and data residing on manifolds. We further examine the models by breaking each category into more detailed sub-categories, as illustrated in\\nFigure 1. In addition, we discuss the connections of diffusion models to other deep generative models (Section 6), including variational autoencoders (VAEs) [122, 194], generative adversarial\\n**networks (GANs) [71], normalizing flows [55, 174, 195], autoregressive models [239], and energy-**\\n**based models (EBMs) [129, 226]. By combining these models with diffusion models, researchers**\\nhave the potential to achieve even stronger performance. Following that, our survey reviews six major categories of application that diffusion models have\\nbeen applied to in the existing research (Section 7): computer vision, natural language processing,\\ntemporal data modeling, multi-modal learning, robust learning, and interdisciplinary applications. For each task, we provide a definition, describe how diffusion models can be employed to address\\nit and summarize relevant previous work. We conclude our paper (Sections 8 and 9) by providing\\nan outlook on possible future directions for this exciting new area of research. **2** **FOUNDATIONS OF DIFFUSION MODELS**\\n\\nDiffusion models are a family of probabilistic generative models that progressively destruct data by\\ninjecting noise, then learn to reverse this process for sample generation.

      "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models are two prominent types of deep generative models that have gained significant attention in recent years. GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator, which compete against each other to produce realistic synthetic data (Goodfellow et al., 2014). Diffusion Models, on the other hand, involve a process of progressively adding noise to the input data and then learning to reverse this process to generate new samples (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015).

      "\n",
      "The latent space is a fundamental component of generative models, representing the compressed and abstracted representation of the input data (Bengio et al., 2013). The structure of the latent space plays a crucial role in determining the quality and diversity of the generated outputs. Common techniques for analyzing and visualizing latent spaces include dimensionality reduction methods, such as PCA and t-SNE, and clustering algorithms, such as k-means and hierarchical clustering (Van der Maaten & Hinton, 2008).\n",

      "**III. Guiding GANs through Latent Space Structure**\n",
      "\n",
      "Several methods have been proposed to guide the outputs of GANs through their latent space structure. Conditional GANs (cGANs) involve conditioning the generator on a specific class label or attribute, allowing for controlled generation of samples (Mirza & Osindero, 2014). Style transfer and style mixing techniques enable the manipulation of the generated images by transferring styles from one image to another (Gatys et al., 2016). Latent space regularization techniques, such as latent optimization and manifold learning, aim to improve the quality and diversity of the generated samples by regularizing the latent space (Zhao et al., 2017).\n",
      "\n",
      "Tools used to manipulate and analyze the latent space of GANs include Generative Adversarial Networks with Encoder (AGE) models, which provide a probabilistic encoding of the input data (Makhzani et al., 2015). Invertible neural networks can be used for latent space inversion, allowing for the manipulation of the generated samples (Dinh et al., 2016). Latent space editing tools, such as face editing and attribute manipulation, enable the controlled modification of the generated images (Shen et al., 2017).\n",

      "**IV. Guiding Diffusion Models through Latent Space Structure**\n",
      "\n",
      "Diffusion Models have unique characteristics that distinguish them from GANs. The latent space of Diffusion Models is typically represented by a sequence of noise schedules, which are used to progressively add noise to the input data (Ho et al., 2019). Conditional Diffusion Models involve conditioning the diffusion process on a specific class label or attribute, allowing for controlled generation of samples (Kwon et al., 2020). Diffusion-based style transfer and image editing techniques enable the manipulation of the generated images by transferring styles from one image to another (Choi et al., 2020).\n",

      "A side-by-side comparison of the methods and tools used to guide GANs and Diffusion Models reveals both similarities and differences between the two approaches. While both models use conditional generation and style transfer techniques, the latent space structure and regularization techniques differ significantly. GANs typically employ a fixed latent space, whereas Diffusion Models use a sequence of noise schedules to represent the latent space.\n",

Adapting these tools for use with Diffusion Models could potentially improve the quality and diversity of the generated samples.\n",

In practice, our Smooth Diffusion is trained on top of\\na well-known text-to-image model: Stable Diffusion [62]. We examine and demonstrate that Smooth Diffusion dramatically improves the latent space smoothness over its\\nbaseline. Meanwhile, we conduct extensive research across\\nnumerous downstream tasks, including but not limited to\\nimage interpolation, inversion, editing, etc. Both qualitative\\nand quantitative results support our conclusion that Smooth\\nDiffusion can be the next-gen high-performing generative\\nmodel not only for the baseline text-to-image task but across\\nvarious downstream tasks. ## 2. Related Work\\n\\n**Diffusion models are initiated from a family of prior works**\\nincluding but not limited to [8, 66, 70, 76]. Since then,\\nDDPM [24] introduced an image-based noise prediction\\nmodel, becoming one of the most popular image generation\\nresearch. Later works [12, 48, 71] extended DDPM, demonstrating that diffusion models perform on-par and even surpass GAN-based methods [15, 30–33]. Recently, generating images from text prompts (T2I) become an emerging field [11, 19, 28, 47, 62], among which diffusion models [16, 49, 59, 62, 64] have become quite visible to the\\npublic. For example, Stable Diffusion (SD) [62] consists of\\nVAE [36] and CLIP [58], diffuses latent space, and yields an\\noutstanding balance between quality and speed. Following\\nSD [62], researchers also explored diffusion approaches for\\ncontrols such as ControlNet [14, 26, 46, 57, 80, 85, 86, 89–\\n91, 95] and multimodal such as Versatile Diffusion [6, 41,\\n73, 88]. Works from a different track reduce diffusion steps\\nto improve speed [5, 34, 39, 43, 65, 72, 92, 96], or restrict\\ndata and domain for few-shot learning [20, 25, 40, 63], all\\nhad successfully maintained a high output quality. **Smooth latent space was one of the prominent proper-**\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nties of SOTA GAN works [9, 31–33], while exploring such\\nproperty went through the decade-long GAN research [3,\\n15], whose goals were mainly robust training. Ideas such as\\nWasserstein GAN [4, 17] had proved to be effective, which\\nenforced the Lipschitz continuity on discriminator via gradient penalties. Another technique, namely path length regularization, related to the Jacobian clamping in [51], was\\nadapted in StyleGAN2 [32] and later became a standard setting for GAN-based generators [10, 37, 87, 94]. Benefiting\\nfrom the smoothness property, researchers managed to manipulate latent space in many downstream research projects. Works such as [7, 50, 68, 83] explored latent space disentanglement. GAN-inverse [1, 2, 52, 84] had also proved\\nto be feasible, along with a family of image editing approaches [18, 53, 56, 60, 61, 74, 97]. As aforementioned,\\nour work aims to investigate the latent space smoothness for\\ndiffusion models, which by far remains unexplored. ## 3.\\n\\n---\\n\\n', 'search_document: See samples in Figure 9 (Appendix G). _2D GAN_ _3D GAN_ _Diffusion model_\\n\\nStyleGAN2 StyleGAN-XL GIRAFFE-HD EG3D LDM-DDIM (η = 0) DDGAN DiffAE\\n\\nID-A 0.561 0.681 0.616 0.468 **0.904** 0.837 0.873\\nID-B 0.604 0.688 0.590 0.454 **0.896** 0.805 0.838\\nID-C 0.495 0.636 0.457 0.403 **0.892** 0.795 0.852\\nID-D 0.554 0.687 0.574 0.436 **0.911** 0.831 0.873\\n\\n#### 5 CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION\\n\\nThis paper provides a unified view of pre-trained generative models by reformulating the latent space\\nof diffusion models. While this reformulation is purely definitional, we show that it allows us to use\\ndiffusion models in similar ways as CycleGANs (Zhu et al., 2017) and GANs. Our CycleDiffusion\\nachieves impressive performance on unpaired image-to-image translation (with two diffusion models\\ntrained on two domains independently) and zero-shot image-to-image translation (with text-to-image\\ndiffusion models). Our definition of latent code also allows diffusion models to be guided in the\\nsame way as GANs (i.e., plug-and-play, without finetuning on noisy images), and results show that\\ndiffusion models have broader coverage of sub-populations and individuals than GANs. Besides the interesting results, it is worth noting that this paper raised more questions than provided\\nanswers. We have provided a formal analysis of the common latent space of stochastic DPMs via the\\nbounded distance between images (Section 3.3), but it still needs further study. Notably, Khrulkov\\n& Oseledets (2022) and Su et al. (2022) studied deterministic DPMs based on optimal transport. Furthermore, efficient plug-and-play guidance for stochastic DPMs on high-resolution images with\\nmany diffusion steps still remains open. These topics can be further explored in future studies.\\n\\n---\\n\\n', 'search_document: We report more detail about mean and global direction in Appendix L.1. ##### 6 CONCLUSION\\n\\nWe proposed a new generative process, Asyrp, which facilitates image editing in a semantic latent\\nspace h-space for pretrained diffusion models. h-space has nice properties as in the latent space\\nof GANs: homogeneity, linearity, robustness, and consistency across timesteps.

Latent Space Navigation\\n\\nRecently, several strategies have been proposed to manipulate the latent structure of pre-trained GANs. These\\nmethods manipulate images in different ways by editing the\\nlatent code and can be divided into two groups. **Supervised Setting.** Supervised approaches typically use\\npre-trained classifiers to guide optimization-based learning\\nto discover interpretable directions that specifically manipulate the properties of interest. InterfaceGAN [26] is a supervised approach that benefits from labeled data including\\n_gender, facial expression and age. It trains binary Support_\\nVector Machines (SVM) [19] on each label and interprets\\nthe normal vectors of the obtained hyperplanes as latent directions. GANalyze [6] finds directions for cognitive image\\nproperties for a pre-trained BigGAN model using an externally trained assessor function. Feedback from the assessor\\nguides the optimization process, and the resulting optimal\\ndirection allows manipulation of the desired cognitive attributes. StyleFlow [1] uses attribute-conditioned continuous normalizing flows that use labels to find edit directions\\nin the latent space of GANs. **Unsupervised Setting.** One of the unsupervised works\\nproposed by [33] discovers meaningful directions using a\\nclassifier-based approach. Given a particular manipulation,\\nthe classifier tries to detect which particular direction is applied. At the end of the optimization process, the method\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nFigure 2: Illustration of LatentCLR. First, each latent code is passed through direction models (denoted with Dk) and up to\\na target feature layer of the GAN (denoted with Gf ) to obtain intermediate representations of edited codes. Then, the effects\\nof direction models are computed by subtracting the representation of the original latent code. Finally, pairs produced by the\\nsame model are considered as positive, and others as negative, in a contrastive loss. learns disentangled directions. Ganspace [9] is a sampling\\nbased unsupervised method where latent vectors are randomly selected from the intermediate layers of BigGAN\\nand StyleGAN models. Then they propose to use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [36] to find principal components that are interpreted as semantically meaningful directions. The principal components lead to a variety of\\nuseful manipulations, including zoom, rotation in BigGAN\\nor changing gender, hair color, or age in StyleGAN models. SeFa [27] follows a related approach, using a closedform solution that specifically optimizes the intermediate\\nweight matrix of the pre-trained GAN model. They obtain interpretable directions in the latent space by computing the eigenvectors of the first projection matrix and selecting the eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalues. A different closed-form solution is proposed by [29] that discovers directions without optimization.\\n\\n---\\n\\n', 'search_document: ## 5. Limitations\\n\\nOur method uses a pre-trained GAN model as input, so\\nit is limited to manipulating GAN-generated images only. However, it can be extended to real images by using GAN\\ninversion methods [40] by encoding the real images into the\\nlatent space. Like any image synthesis tool, our method also\\nposes similar concerns and dangers in terms of misuse, as\\nit can be applied to images of people or faces for malicious\\npurposes, as discussed in [14].\\n\\n---\\n\\n', 'search_document: ## 2. Related Work\\n\\nIn this section, we introduce generative adversarial networks and discuss latent space manipulation methods. ### 2.1. Generative Adversarial Networks\\n\\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of a\\ngenerator and a discriminator for mapping the real world to\\nthe generative space [7]. The discriminator part of the network tries to detect whether images are from the training\\ndataset or synthetic, while the generative part tries to generate images that are similar to the dataset. StyleGAN [11]\\nand StyleGAN2 are among the popular GAN approaches\\nthat are capable of generating high-quality images. They\\nuse a mapping network consisting of an 8-layer perceptron\\nthat aims to map the input latent code to an intermediate\\nlatent space. Another popular GAN model is BigGAN [2],\\na large-scale model trained on ImageNet. Similar to StyleGAN2, it also makes use of intermediate layers by using the\\nlatent vector as input, also called skip-z inputs, as well as a\\nclass vector. Due to its conditional architecture, it can generate images in a variety of categories from ImageNet. In\\nthis paper, we work with pre-trained StyleGAN2 and BigGAN models.\\n\\n---\\n\\n', 'search_document: (2021) [95], and Kingma et al. (2021) [120] demonstrate that the score matching objective may be approximated by the Evidence\\n**Lower Bound (ELBO) of a deep hierarchical VAE. Consequently, optimizing a diffusion model can**\\nbe seen as training an infinitely deep hierarchical VAE—a finding that supports the common belief\\nthat Score SDE diffusion models can be interpreted as the continuous limit of hierarchical VAEs. The Latent Score-Based Generative Model (LSGM) [238] furthers this line of research by illustrating that the ELBO can be considered a specialized score matching objective in the context of\\nlatent space diffusion. Though the cross-entropy term in the ELBO is intractable, it can be transformed into a tractable score matching objective by viewing the score-based generative model as\\nan infinitely deep VAE. **6.2** **Generative Adversarial Networks and Connections with Diffusion Models**\\n\\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [45, 71, 79] mainly consist of two models: a generator G\\nand a discriminator D. These two models are typically constructed by neural networks but could\\nbe implemented in any form of a differentiable system that maps input data from one space to\\nanother. The optimization of GANs can be viewed as a minimax optimization problem with value\\nfunction V (G, D):\\n\\nmin (41)\\n\\n_G_ [max]D [E][x][∼][p][data] [(][x][)][[log][ D] [(][x][)][]][ +][ E][z][∼][p][z] [(][z][)][[log][(][1][ −] _[D][(][G]_ [(][z][)))][]][.]\\n\\n\\nThe generator G aims to generate new examples and implicitly model the data distribution. The\\ndiscriminator D is usually a binary classifier that is used to identify generated examples from true\\nexamples with maximally possible accuracy. The optimization process ends at a saddle point that\\nproduces a minimum about the generator and a maximum about the discriminator. Namely, the\\ngoal of GAN optimization is to achieve Nash equilibrium [192]. At that point, the generator can\\nbe considered that it has captured the accurate distribution of real examples. One of the issues of GAN is the instability in the training process, which is mainly caused\\nby the non-overlapping between the distribution of input data and that of the generated data.

While this reformulation is purely definitional, we show that it allows us to use\\ndiffusion models in similar ways as CycleGANs (Zhu et al., 2017) and GANs. Our CycleDiffusion\\nachieves impressive performance on unpaired image-to-image translation (with two diffusion models\\ntrained on two domains independently) and zero-shot image-to-image translation (with text-to-image\\ndiffusion models). Our definition of latent code also allows diffusion models to be guided in the\\nsame way as GANs (i.e., plug-and-play, without finetuning on noisy images), and results show that\\ndiffusion models have broader coverage of sub-populations and individuals than GANs. Besides the interesting results, it is worth noting that this paper raised more questions than provided\\nanswers. We have provided a formal analysis of the common latent space of stochastic DPMs via the\\nbounded distance between images (Section 3.3), but it still needs further study. Notably, Khrulkov\\n& Oseledets (2022) and Su et al. (2022) studied deterministic DPMs based on optimal transport. Furthermore, efficient plug-and-play guidance for stochastic DPMs on high-resolution images with\\nmany diffusion steps still remains open. These topics can be further explored in future studies.\\n\\n---\\n\\n', 'search_document: We report more detail about mean and global direction in Appendix L.1. ##### 6 CONCLUSION\\n\\nWe proposed a new generative process, Asyrp, which facilitates image editing in a semantic latent\\nspace h-space for pretrained diffusion models. h-space has nice properties as in the latent space\\nof GANs: homogeneity, linearity, robustness, and consistency across timesteps.

Yang et al. **1** **INTRODUCTION**\\n\\nDiffusion models [87, 218, 223, 228] have emerged as the new state-of-the-art family of deep\\ngenerative models. They have broken the long-time dominance of generative adversarial net**works (GANs) [71] in the challenging task of image synthesis [54, 87, 223, 228] and have**\\nalso shown potential in a variety of domains, ranging from computer vision [2, 11, 19, 23, 88,\\n90, 113, 115, 134, 150, 160, 173, 198, 200, 248, 270, 271, 283, 290], natural language processing [6, 93, 139, 205, 275], temporal data modeling [1, 33, 124, 191, 233, 262], multi-modal modeling [7, 186, 196, 199, 288], robust machine learning [18, 28, 112, 242, 273], to interdisciplinary\\napplications in fields such as computational chemistry [3, 91, 104, 130, 132, 152, 258] and medical\\nimage reconstruction [25, 41–43, 48, 158, 177, 227, 259]. Numerous methods have been developed to improve diffusion models, either by enhancing empirical performance [165, 220, 224] or by extending the model capacity from a theoretical perspective [144, 145, 222, 228, 279]. Over the past two years, the body of research on diffusion models has\\ngrown significantly, making it increasingly challenging for new researchers to stay abreast of the\\nrecent developments in the field. Additionally, the sheer volume of work can obscure major trends\\nand hinder further research progress. This survey aims to address these problems by providing a\\ncomprehensive overview of the state of diffusion model research, categorizing various approaches,\\nand highlighting key advances. In this paper, we first explain the foundations of diffusion models (Section 2), providing a brief\\nbut self-contained introduction to three predominant formulations: denoising diffusion prob**abilistic models (DDPMs) [87, 218], score-based generative models (SGMs) [223, 224], and**\\n**stochastic differential equations (Score SDEs) [111, 222, 228]. Key to all these approaches is**\\nto progressively perturb data with intensifying random noise (called the “diffusion” process), then\\nsuccessively remove noise to generate new data samples. We clarify how they work under the\\nsame principle of diffusion and explain how these three models are connected and can be reduced\\nto one another. Next, we present a taxonomy of recent research that maps out the field of diffusion models,\\ncategorizing it into three key areas: efficient sampling (Section 3), improved likelihood estimation\\n(Section 4), and methods for handling data with special structures (Section 5), such as relational\\ndata, data with permutation/rotational invariance, and data residing on manifolds. We further examine the models by breaking each category into more detailed sub-categories, as illustrated in\\nFigure 1. In addition, we discuss the connections of diffusion models to other deep generative models (Section 6), including variational autoencoders (VAEs) [122, 194], generative adversarial\\n**networks (GANs) [71], normalizing flows [55, 174, 195], autoregressive models [239], and energy-**\\n**based models (EBMs) [129, 226]. By combining these models with diffusion models, researchers**\\nhave the potential to achieve even stronger performance. Following that, our survey reviews six major categories of application that diffusion models have\\nbeen applied to in the existing research (Section 7): computer vision, natural language processing,\\ntemporal data modeling, multi-modal learning, robust learning, and interdisciplinary applications. For each task, we provide a definition, describe how diffusion models can be employed to address\\nit and summarize relevant previous work. We conclude our paper (Sections 8 and 9) by providing\\nan outlook on possible future directions for this exciting new area of research. **2** **FOUNDATIONS OF DIFFUSION MODELS**\\n\\nDiffusion models are a family of probabilistic generative models that progressively destruct data by\\ninjecting noise, then learn to reverse this process for sample generation.

While this reformulation is purely definitional, we show that it allows us to use\\ndiffusion models in similar ways as CycleGANs (Zhu et al., 2017) and GANs. Our CycleDiffusion\\nachieves impressive performance on unpaired image-to-image translation (with two diffusion models\\ntrained on two domains independently) and zero-shot image-to-image translation (with text-to-image\\ndiffusion models). Our definition of latent code also allows diffusion models to be guided in the\\nsame way as GANs (i.e., plug-and-play, without finetuning on noisy images), and results show that\\ndiffusion models have broader coverage of sub-populations and individuals than GANs. Besides the interesting results, it is worth noting that this paper raised more questions than provided\\nanswers. We have provided a formal analysis of the common latent space of stochastic DPMs via the\\nbounded distance between images (Section 3.3), but it still needs further study. Notably, Khrulkov\\n& Oseledets (2022) and Su et al. (2022) studied deterministic DPMs based on optimal transport. Furthermore, efficient plug-and-play guidance for stochastic DPMs on high-resolution images with\\nmany diffusion steps still remains open. These topics can be further explored in future studies.\\n\\n---\\n\\n', 'search_document: We report more detail about mean and global direction in Appendix L.1. ##### 6 CONCLUSION\\n\\nWe proposed a new generative process, Asyrp, which facilitates image editing in a semantic latent\\nspace h-space for pretrained diffusion models. h-space has nice properties as in the latent space\\nof GANs: homogeneity, linearity, robustness, and consistency across timesteps. The full editing\\nprocess is designed to achieve versatile editing and high quality by measuring editing strength and\\nquality deficiency at timesteps. We hope that our approach and detailed analyses help cultivate a new\\nparadigm of image editing in the semantic latent space of diffusion models. Combining previous\\nfinetuning or guidance techniques would be an interesting research direction.', 'search_document: ## 2. Related Work\\n\\nIn this section, we introduce generative adversarial networks and discuss latent space manipulation methods. ### 2.1. Generative Adversarial Networks\\n\\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of a\\ngenerator and a discriminator for mapping the real world to\\nthe generative space [7]. The discriminator part of the network tries to detect whether images are from the training\\ndataset or synthetic, while the generative part tries to generate images that are similar to the dataset. StyleGAN [11]\\nand StyleGAN2 are among the popular GAN approaches\\nthat are capable of generating high-quality images. They\\nuse a mapping network consisting of an 8-layer perceptron\\nthat aims to map the input latent code to an intermediate\\nlatent space. Another popular GAN model is BigGAN [2],\\na large-scale model trained on ImageNet. Similar to StyleGAN2, it also makes use of intermediate layers by using the\\nlatent vector as input, also called skip-z inputs, as well as a\\nclass vector. Due to its conditional architecture, it can generate images in a variety of categories from ImageNet. In\\nthis paper, we work with pre-trained StyleGAN2 and BigGAN models.\\n\\n---\\n\\n', 'search_document: 2018. Generative adversarial networks: An overview.

Yang et al. **1** **INTRODUCTION**\\n\\nDiffusion models [87, 218, 223, 228] have emerged as the new state-of-the-art family of deep\\ngenerative models. They have broken the long-time dominance of generative adversarial net**works (GANs) [71] in the challenging task of image synthesis [54, 87, 223, 228] and have**\\nalso shown potential in a variety of domains, ranging from computer vision [2, 11, 19, 23, 88,\\n90, 113, 115, 134, 150, 160, 173, 198, 200, 248, 270, 271, 283, 290], natural language processing [6, 93, 139, 205, 275], temporal data modeling [1, 33, 124, 191, 233, 262], multi-modal modeling [7, 186, 196, 199, 288], robust machine learning [18, 28, 112, 242, 273], to interdisciplinary\\napplications in fields such as computational chemistry [3, 91, 104, 130, 132, 152, 258] and medical\\nimage reconstruction [25, 41–43, 48, 158, 177, 227, 259]. Numerous methods have been developed to improve diffusion models, either by enhancing empirical performance [165, 220, 224] or by extending the model capacity from a theoretical perspective [144, 145, 222, 228, 279]. Over the past two years, the body of research on diffusion models has\\ngrown significantly, making it increasingly challenging for new researchers to stay abreast of the\\nrecent developments in the field. Additionally, the sheer volume of work can obscure major trends\\nand hinder further research progress. This survey aims to address these problems by providing a\\ncomprehensive overview of the state of diffusion model research, categorizing various approaches,\\nand highlighting key advances. In this paper, we first explain the foundations of diffusion models (Section 2), providing a brief\\nbut self-contained introduction to three predominant formulations: denoising diffusion prob**abilistic models (DDPMs) [87, 218], score-based generative models (SGMs) [223, 224], and**\\n**stochastic differential equations (Score SDEs) [111, 222, 228]. Key to all these approaches is**\\nto progressively perturb data with intensifying random noise (called the “diffusion” process), then\\nsuccessively remove noise to generate new data samples. We clarify how they work under the\\nsame principle of diffusion and explain how these three models are connected and can be reduced\\nto one another. Next, we present a taxonomy of recent research that maps out the field of diffusion models,\\ncategorizing it into three key areas: efficient sampling (Section 3), improved likelihood estimation\\n(Section 4), and methods for handling data with special structures (Section 5), such as relational\\ndata, data with permutation/rotational invariance, and data residing on manifolds. We further examine the models by breaking each category into more detailed sub-categories, as illustrated in\\nFigure 1. In addition, we discuss the connections of diffusion models to other deep generative models (Section 6), including variational autoencoders (VAEs) [122, 194], generative adversarial\\n**networks (GANs) [71], normalizing flows [55, 174, 195], autoregressive models [239], and energy-**\\n**based models (EBMs) [129, 226]. By combining these models with diffusion models, researchers**\\nhave the potential to achieve even stronger performance. Following that, our survey reviews six major categories of application that diffusion models have\\nbeen applied to in the existing research (Section 7): computer vision, natural language processing,\\ntemporal data modeling, multi-modal learning, robust learning, and interdisciplinary applications. For each task, we provide a definition, describe how diffusion models can be employed to address\\nit and summarize relevant previous work. We conclude our paper (Sections 8 and 9) by providing\\nan outlook on possible future directions for this exciting new area of research. **2** **FOUNDATIONS OF DIFFUSION MODELS**\\n\\nDiffusion models are a family of probabilistic generative models that progressively destruct data by\\ninjecting noise, then learn to reverse this process for sample generation.

DALLE-2 [186] employs a similar strategy by training a diffusion model on the CLIP image embedding space, followed by training a separate decoder to create images based on the CLIP image\\nembeddings. **6** **CONNECTIONS WITH OTHER GENERATIVE MODELS**\\nIn this section, we first introduce five other important classes of generative models and analyze\\ntheir advantages and limitations. Then we introduce how diffusion models are connected with\\nthem, and illustrate how these generative models improve by incorporating diffusion models. We\\nprovide a schematic illustration in Figure 3, and quantitative (with Frechet Inception Distance,\\ndenoted as FID) and qualitative comparisons in Figure 4. **6.1** **Variational Autoencoders and Connections with Diffusion Models**\\nVariational Autoencoders [61, 123, 194] aim to learn both an encoder and a decoder to map input\\ndata to values in a continuous latent space. In these models, the embedding can be interpreted as\\na latent variable in a probabilistic generative model, and a probabilistic decoder can be formulated\\nby a parameterized likelihood function. In addition, the data x is assumed to be generated by some\\nunobserved latent variable z using conditional distribution pθ (x | z), and qϕ (z | x) is used to\\napproximately inference z.

This\\nformulation allows flexible choice of encoder and decoder models. Typically, these models are\\nrepresented by exponential family distributions whose parameters are generated by multi-layer\\nneural networks. The DDPM can be conceptualized as a hierarchical Markovian VAE with a fixed encoder. Specifically, DDPM’s forward process functions as the encoder, and this process is structured as a linear\\nGaussian model (as described by Equation (2)).

The commonly-adopted formulation of the latent code of diffusion models is a\\nsequence of gradually denoised samples, as opposed to the simpler (e.g., Gaussian)\\nlatent space of GANs, VAEs, and normalizing flows. This paper provides an alternative, Gaussian formulation of the latent space of diffusion models, as well as a\\nreconstructable DPM-Encoder that maps images into the latent space. While our\\nformulation is purely based on the definition of diffusion models, we demonstrate\\nseveral intriguing consequences. (1) Empirically, we observe that a common latent\\nspace emerges from two diffusion models trained independently on related domains. In light of this finding, we propose CycleDiffusion, which uses DPM-Encoder for\\nunpaired image-to-image translation. Furthermore, applying CycleDiffusion to\\ntext-to-image diffusion models, we show that large-scale text-to-image diffusion\\nmodels can be used as zero-shot image-to-image editors. (2) One can guide pretrained diffusion models and GANs by controlling the latent codes in a unified,\\nplug-and-play formulation based on energy-based models. Using the CLIP model\\nand a face recognition model as guidance, we demonstrate that diffusion models\\nhave better coverage of low-density sub-populations and individuals than GANs.[1]\\n\\n#### 1 INTRODUCTION\\n\\n\\nDiffusion models (Song & Ermon, 2019; Ho et al., 2020) have achieved unprecedented results in\\ngenerative modeling and are instrumental to text-to-image models such as DALL·E 2 (Ramesh et al.,\\n2022). Unlike GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014), VAEs (Kingma & Welling, 2014), and normalizing\\nflows (Dinh et al., 2015), which have a simple (e.g., Gaussian) latent space, the commonly-adopted\\nformulation of the “latent code” of diffusion models is a sequence of gradually denoised images. This\\nformulation makes the prior distribution of the “latent code” data-dependent, deviating from the idea\\nthat generative models are mappings from simple noises to data (Goodfellow et al., 2014). This paper provides a unified view of generative models of images by reformulating various diffusion\\nmodels as deterministic maps from a Gaussian latent code z to an image x (Figure 1, Section 3.1). A\\nquestion that follows is encoding: how to map an image x to a latent code z. Encoding has been\\nstudied for many generative models. For instance, VAEs and normalizing flows have encoders by\\ndesign, GAN inversion (Xia et al., 2021) builds post hoc encoders for GANs, and deterministic\\ndiffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) (Song et al., 2021a;b) build encoders with forward ODEs. However, it is still unclear how to build an encoder for stochastic DPMs such as DDPM (Ho et al.,\\n2020), non-deterministic DDIM (Song et al., 2021a), and latent diffusion models (Rombach et al.,\\n2022). We propose DPM-Encoder (Section 3.2), a reconstructable encoder for stochastic DPMs. We show that some intriguing consequences emerge from our definition of the latent space of\\ndiffusion models and our DPM-Encoder. First, observations have been made that, given two diffusion\\nmodels, a fixed “random seed” produces similar images (Nichol et al., 2022). Under our formulation,\\nwe formalize “similar images” via an upper bound of image distances.

With the CLIP model and a face recognition model as guidance, we show that\\ndiffusion models have broader coverage of low-density sub-populations and individuals (Section 4.3). #### 2 RELATED WORK\\n\\nRecent years have witnessed a great progress in generative models, such as GANs (Goodfellow et al.,\\n2014), diffusion models (Song & Ermon, 2019; Ho et al., 2020; Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021), VAEs\\n(Kingma & Welling, 2014), normalizing flows (Dinh et al., 2015), and their hybrid extensions (Sinha\\net al., 2021; Vahdat et al., 2021; Zhang & Chen, 2021; Kim et al., 2022a). Previous works have shown\\nthat their training objectives are related, e.g., diffusion models as VAEs (Ho et al., 2020; Kingma\\net al., 2021; Huang et al., 2021); GANs and VAEs as KL divergences (Hu et al., 2018) or mutual\\ninformation with consistency constraints (Zhao et al., 2018); a recent attempt (Zhang et al., 2022b)\\nhas been made to unify several generative models as GFlowNets (Bengio et al., 2021). In contrast,\\nthis paper unifies generative models as deterministic mappings from Gaussian noises to data (aka\\nimplicit models) once they are trained. Generative models with non-Gaussian randomness (Davidson\\net al., 2018; Nachmani et al., 2021) can be unified as deterministic mappings in similar ways. One of the most fundamental challenges in generative modeling is to design an encoder that is both\\ncomputationally efficient and invertible. GAN inversion trains an encoder after GANs are pre-trained\\n(Xia et al., 2021). VAEs and normalizing flows have their encoders by design.']\n",

      "\n",
      "**I. Introduction**\n",
      "\n",
      "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models are two prominent types of deep generative models that have gained significant attention in recent years. GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator, which compete against each other to produce realistic synthetic data (Goodfellow et al., 2014). Diffusion Models, on the other hand, involve a process of progressively adding noise to the input data and then learning to reverse this process to generate new samples (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015). The ability to guide the outputs of these models is crucial for real-world applications, such as image editing, data augmentation, and style transfer. This report compares and contrasts the methods and tools used to guide the outputs of GANs and Diffusion Models through the structure of their latent spaces, highlighting potential tools that have not been applied to Diffusion Models.\n",
      "\n",
      "**II. Background on Latent Space Structure**\n",
      "\n",
      "The latent space is a fundamental component of generative models, representing the compressed and abstracted representation of the input data (Bengio et al., 2013). The structure of the latent space plays a crucial role in determining the quality and diversity of the generated outputs. Common techniques for analyzing and visualizing latent spaces include dimensionality reduction methods, such as PCA and t-SNE, and clustering algorithms, such as k-means and hierarchical clustering (Van der Maaten & Hinton, 2008). For instance, PCA can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the latent space, while t-SNE can be used to visualize the latent space in a lower-dimensional representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**III. Guiding GANs through Latent Space Structure**\n",
      "\n",
      "Several methods have been proposed to guide the outputs of GANs through their latent space structure. Conditional GANs (cGANs) involve conditioning the generator on a specific class label or attribute, allowing for controlled generation of samples (Mirza & Osindero, 2014). Style transfer and style mixing techniques enable the manipulation of the generated images by transferring styles from one image to another (Gatys et al., 2016). Latent space regularization techniques, such as latent optimization and manifold learning, aim to improve the quality and diversity of the generated samples by regularizing the latent space (Zhao et al., 2017).\n",
      "\n",
      "Tools used to manipulate and analyze the latent space of GANs include Generative Adversarial Networks with Encoder (AGE) models, which provide a probabilistic encoding of the input data (Makhzani et al., 2015). Invertible neural networks can be used for latent space inversion, allowing for the manipulation of the generated samples (Dinh et al., 2016). Latent space editing tools, such as face editing and attribute manipulation, enable the controlled modification of the generated images (Shen et al., 2017).\n",
      "\n",
      "**IV. Guiding Diffusion Models through Latent Space Structure**\n",
      "\n",
      "Diffusion Models have unique characteristics that distinguish them from GANs. The latent space of Diffusion Models is typically represented by a sequence of noise schedules, which are used to progressively add noise to the input data (Ho et al., 2019). Conditional Diffusion Models involve conditioning the diffusion process on a specific class label or attribute, allowing for controlled generation of samples (Kwon et al., 2020). Diffusion-based style transfer and image editing techniques enable the manipulation of the generated images by transferring styles from one image to another (Choi et al., 2020).\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, Diffusion Models can be used for image-to-image translation tasks, such as converting daytime images to nighttime images. This is achieved by conditioning the diffusion process on the daytime image and then generating a nighttime image that preserves the same content and structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "**V. Comparison of Methods and Tools**\n",
      "\n",
      "A side-by-side comparison of the methods and tools used to guide GANs and Diffusion Models reveals both similarities and differences between the two approaches. While both models use conditional generation and style transfer techniques, the latent space structure and regularization techniques differ significantly. GANs typically employ a fixed latent space, whereas Diffusion Models use a sequence of noise schedules to represent the latent space.\n",
      "\n",
      "**VI. Unexplored Tools for Diffusion Models**\n",
      "\n",
      "Several tools developed for GANs have not been applied to Diffusion Models, including AGE models for latent space encoding and decoding, latent optimization techniques for improved mode coverage, and manifold learning methods for discovering underlying structures in the latent space. Adapting these tools for use with Diffusion Models could potentially improve the quality and diversity of the generated samples.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, AGE models can be used to encode the input data into a probabilistic latent space, which can then be used to generate new samples. Similarly, latent optimization techniques can be used to improve the mode coverage of the generated samples, resulting in more diverse and realistic outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**VII. Future Directions**\n",
      "\n",
      "Future research directions for guiding generative models include developing new tools and methods for analyzing and manipulating the latent space structure of Diffusion Models. This could involve adapting existing techniques from GANs, such as AGE models and latent optimization, or developing new methods that take advantage of the unique characteristics of Diffusion Models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another potential area of research is exploring the use of Diffusion Models for multimodal generation tasks, such as generating images and text simultaneously. This could involve conditioning the diffusion process on a specific modality, such as text, and then generating a corresponding image that preserves the same content and structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "**VIII. Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, this report has compared and contrasted the methods and tools used to guide the outputs of GANs and Diffusion Models through their latent space structures. While both models share some similarities, significant differences exist in their latent space representations and regularization techniques. Further research is needed to develop new tools and methods for guiding the outputs of generative models, particularly Diffusion Models.\n",

To understand the latent space xt ∈X, we analyze them\\nfrom a geometrical perspective.\\n\\n---\\n\\n', 'search_document: 3. In practice, our Smooth Diffusion is trained on top of\\na well-known text-to-image model: Stable Diffusion [62]. We examine and demonstrate that Smooth Diffusion dramatically improves the latent space smoothness over its\\nbaseline. Meanwhile, we conduct extensive research across\\nnumerous downstream tasks, including but not limited to\\nimage interpolation, inversion, editing, etc. Both qualitative\\nand quantitative results support our conclusion that Smooth\\nDiffusion can be the next-gen high-performing generative\\nmodel not only for the baseline text-to-image task but across\\nvarious downstream tasks. ## 2. Related Work\\n\\n**Diffusion models are initiated from a family of prior works**\\nincluding but not limited to [8, 66, 70, 76]. Since then,\\nDDPM [24] introduced an image-based noise prediction\\nmodel, becoming one of the most popular image generation\\nresearch. Later works [12, 48, 71] extended DDPM, demonstrating that diffusion models perform on-par and even surpass GAN-based methods [15, 30–33]. Recently, generating images from text prompts (T2I) become an emerging field [11, 19, 28, 47, 62], among which diffusion models [16, 49, 59, 62, 64] have become quite visible to the\\npublic. For example, Stable Diffusion (SD) [62] consists of\\nVAE [36] and CLIP [58], diffuses latent space, and yields an\\noutstanding balance between quality and speed. Following\\nSD [62], researchers also explored diffusion approaches for\\ncontrols such as ControlNet [14, 26, 46, 57, 80, 85, 86, 89–\\n91, 95] and multimodal such as Versatile Diffusion [6, 41,\\n73, 88]. Works from a different track reduce diffusion steps\\nto improve speed [5, 34, 39, 43, 65, 72, 92, 96], or restrict\\ndata and domain for few-shot learning [20, 25, 40, 63], all\\nhad successfully maintained a high output quality. **Smooth latent space was one of the prominent proper-**\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nties of SOTA GAN works [9, 31–33], while exploring such\\nproperty went through the decade-long GAN research [3,\\n15], whose goals were mainly robust training. Ideas such as\\nWasserstein GAN [4, 17] had proved to be effective, which\\nenforced the Lipschitz continuity on discriminator via gradient penalties. Another technique, namely path length regularization, related to the Jacobian clamping in [51], was\\nadapted in StyleGAN2 [32] and later became a standard setting for GAN-based generators [10, 37, 87, 94]. Benefiting\\nfrom the smoothness property, researchers managed to manipulate latent space in many downstream research projects. Works such as [7, 50, 68, 83] explored latent space disentanglement. GAN-inverse [1, 2, 52, 84] had also proved\\nto be feasible, along with a family of image editing approaches [18, 53, 56, 60, 61, 74, 97]. As aforementioned,\\nour work aims to investigate the latent space smoothness for\\ndiffusion models, which by far remains unexplored. ## 3.\\n\\n---\\n\\n', 'search_document: See samples in Figure 9 (Appendix G). _2D GAN_ _3D GAN_ _Diffusion model_\\n\\nStyleGAN2 StyleGAN-XL GIRAFFE-HD EG3D LDM-DDIM (η = 0) DDGAN DiffAE\\n\\nID-A 0.561 0.681 0.616 0.468 **0.904** 0.837 0.873\\nID-B 0.604 0.688 0.590 0.454 **0.896** 0.805 0.838\\nID-C 0.495 0.636 0.457 0.403 **0.892** 0.795 0.852\\nID-D 0.554 0.687 0.574 0.436 **0.911** 0.831 0.873\\n\\n#### 5 CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION\\n\\nThis paper provides a unified view of pre-trained generative models by reformulating the latent space\\nof diffusion models. While this reformulation is purely definitional, we show that it allows us to use\\ndiffusion models in similar ways as CycleGANs (Zhu et al., 2017) and GANs. Our CycleDiffusion\\nachieves impressive performance on unpaired image-to-image translation (with two diffusion models\\ntrained on two domains independently) and zero-shot image-to-image translation (with text-to-image\\ndiffusion models). Our definition of latent code also allows diffusion models to be guided in the\\nsame way as GANs (i.e., plug-and-play, without finetuning on noisy images), and results show that\\ndiffusion models have broader coverage of sub-populations and individuals than GANs. Besides the interesting results, it is worth noting that this paper raised more questions than provided\\nanswers. We have provided a formal analysis of the common latent space of stochastic DPMs via the\\nbounded distance between images (Section 3.3), but it still needs further study. Notably, Khrulkov\\n& Oseledets (2022) and Su et al. (2022) studied deterministic DPMs based on optimal transport.

Latent Space Navigation\\n\\nRecently, several strategies have been proposed to manipulate the latent structure of pre-trained GANs. These\\nmethods manipulate images in different ways by editing the\\nlatent code and can be divided into two groups. **Supervised Setting.** Supervised approaches typically use\\npre-trained classifiers to guide optimization-based learning\\nto discover interpretable directions that specifically manipulate the properties of interest. InterfaceGAN [26] is a supervised approach that benefits from labeled data including\\n_gender, facial expression and age. It trains binary Support_\\nVector Machines (SVM) [19] on each label and interprets\\nthe normal vectors of the obtained hyperplanes as latent directions. GANalyze [6] finds directions for cognitive image\\nproperties for a pre-trained BigGAN model using an externally trained assessor function. Feedback from the assessor\\nguides the optimization process, and the resulting optimal\\ndirection allows manipulation of the desired cognitive attributes. StyleFlow [1] uses attribute-conditioned continuous normalizing flows that use labels to find edit directions\\nin the latent space of GANs. **Unsupervised Setting.** One of the unsupervised works\\nproposed by [33] discovers meaningful directions using a\\nclassifier-based approach. Given a particular manipulation,\\nthe classifier tries to detect which particular direction is applied. At the end of the optimization process, the method\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nFigure 2: Illustration of LatentCLR. First, each latent code is passed through direction models (denoted with Dk) and up to\\na target feature layer of the GAN (denoted with Gf ) to obtain intermediate representations of edited codes. Then, the effects\\nof direction models are computed by subtracting the representation of the original latent code. Finally, pairs produced by the\\nsame model are considered as positive, and others as negative, in a contrastive loss. learns disentangled directions. Ganspace [9] is a sampling\\nbased unsupervised method where latent vectors are randomly selected from the intermediate layers of BigGAN\\nand StyleGAN models. Then they propose to use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [36] to find principal components that are interpreted as semantically meaningful directions. The principal components lead to a variety of\\nuseful manipulations, including zoom, rotation in BigGAN\\nor changing gender, hair color, or age in StyleGAN models. SeFa [27] follows a related approach, using a closedform solution that specifically optimizes the intermediate\\nweight matrix of the pre-trained GAN model. They obtain interpretable directions in the latent space by computing the eigenvectors of the first projection matrix and selecting the eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalues. A different closed-form solution is proposed by [29] that discovers directions without optimization.\\n\\n---\\n\\n', 'search_document: ## 5. Limitations\\n\\nOur method uses a pre-trained GAN model as input, so\\nit is limited to manipulating GAN-generated images only. However, it can be extended to real images by using GAN\\ninversion methods [40] by encoding the real images into the\\nlatent space. Like any image synthesis tool, our method also\\nposes similar concerns and dangers in terms of misuse, as\\nit can be applied to images of people or faces for malicious\\npurposes, as discussed in [14].\\n\\n---\\n\\n', 'search_document: ## 2. Related Work\\n\\nIn this section, we introduce generative adversarial networks and discuss latent space manipulation methods. ### 2.1. Generative Adversarial Networks\\n\\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of a\\ngenerator and a discriminator for mapping the real world to\\nthe generative space [7]. The discriminator part of the network tries to detect whether images are from the training\\ndataset or synthetic, while the generative part tries to generate images that are similar to the dataset. StyleGAN [11]\\nand StyleGAN2 are among the popular GAN approaches\\nthat are capable of generating high-quality images. They\\nuse a mapping network consisting of an 8-layer perceptron\\nthat aims to map the input latent code to an intermediate\\nlatent space. Another popular GAN model is BigGAN [2],\\na large-scale model trained on ImageNet. Similar to StyleGAN2, it also makes use of intermediate layers by using the\\nlatent vector as input, also called skip-z inputs, as well as a\\nclass vector. Due to its conditional architecture, it can generate images in a variety of categories from ImageNet. In\\nthis paper, we work with pre-trained StyleGAN2 and BigGAN models.\\n\\n---\\n\\n', 'search_document: (2021) [95], and Kingma et al. (2021) [120] demonstrate that the score matching objective may be approximated by the Evidence\\n**Lower Bound (ELBO) of a deep hierarchical VAE. Consequently, optimizing a diffusion model can**\\nbe seen as training an infinitely deep hierarchical VAE—a finding that supports the common belief\\nthat Score SDE diffusion models can be interpreted as the continuous limit of hierarchical VAEs. The Latent Score-Based Generative Model (LSGM) [238] furthers this line of research by illustrating that the ELBO can be considered a specialized score matching objective in the context of\\nlatent space diffusion. Though the cross-entropy term in the ELBO is intractable, it can be transformed into a tractable score matching objective by viewing the score-based generative model as\\nan infinitely deep VAE. **6.2** **Generative Adversarial Networks and Connections with Diffusion Models**\\n\\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [45, 71, 79] mainly consist of two models: a generator G\\nand a discriminator D. These two models are typically constructed by neural networks but could\\nbe implemented in any form of a differentiable system that maps input data from one space to\\nanother. The optimization of GANs can be viewed as a minimax optimization problem with value\\nfunction V (G, D):\\n\\nmin (41)\\n\\n_G_ [max]D [E][x][∼][p][data] [(][x][)][[log][ D] [(][x][)][]][ +][ E][z][∼][p][z] [(][z][)][[log][(][1][ −] _[D][(][G]_ [(][z][)))][]][.]\\n\\n\\nThe generator G aims to generate new examples and implicitly model the data distribution. The\\ndiscriminator D is usually a binary classifier that is used to identify generated examples from true\\nexamples with maximally possible accuracy. The optimization process ends at a saddle point that\\nproduces a minimum about the generator and a maximum about the discriminator. Namely, the\\ngoal of GAN optimization is to achieve Nash equilibrium [192]. At that point, the generator can\\nbe considered that it has captured the accurate distribution of real examples. One of the issues of GAN is the instability in the training process, which is mainly caused\\nby the non-overlapping between the distribution of input data and that of the generated data.

Related Work\\n\\n**Diffusion models are initiated from a family of prior works**\\nincluding but not limited to [8, 66, 70, 76]. Since then,\\nDDPM [24] introduced an image-based noise prediction\\nmodel, becoming one of the most popular image generation\\nresearch. Later works [12, 48, 71] extended DDPM, demonstrating that diffusion models perform on-par and even surpass GAN-based methods [15, 30–33]. Recently, generating images from text prompts (T2I) become an emerging field [11, 19, 28, 47, 62], among which diffusion models [16, 49, 59, 62, 64] have become quite visible to the\\npublic. For example, Stable Diffusion (SD) [62] consists of\\nVAE [36] and CLIP [58], diffuses latent space, and yields an\\noutstanding balance between quality and speed. Following\\nSD [62], researchers also explored diffusion approaches for\\ncontrols such as ControlNet [14, 26, 46, 57, 80, 85, 86, 89–\\n91, 95] and multimodal such as Versatile Diffusion [6, 41,\\n73, 88]. Works from a different track reduce diffusion steps\\nto improve speed [5, 34, 39, 43, 65, 72, 92, 96], or restrict\\ndata and domain for few-shot learning [20, 25, 40, 63], all\\nhad successfully maintained a high output quality. **Smooth latent space was one of the prominent proper-**\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nties of SOTA GAN works [9, 31–33], while exploring such\\nproperty went through the decade-long GAN research [3,\\n15], whose goals were mainly robust training.

Another technique, namely path length regularization, related to the Jacobian clamping in [51], was\\nadapted in StyleGAN2 [32] and later became a standard setting for GAN-based generators [10, 37, 87, 94]. Benefiting\\nfrom the smoothness property, researchers managed to manipulate latent space in many downstream research projects. Works such as [7, 50, 68, 83] explored latent space disentanglement. GAN-inverse [1, 2, 52, 84] had also proved\\nto be feasible, along with a family of image editing approaches [18, 53, 56, 60, 61, 74, 97].

They have broken the long-time dominance of generative adversarial net**works (GANs) [71] in the challenging task of image synthesis [54, 87, 223, 228] and have**\\nalso shown potential in a variety of domains, ranging from computer vision [2, 11, 19, 23, 88,\\n90, 113, 115, 134, 150, 160, 173, 198, 200, 248, 270, 271, 283, 290], natural language processing [6, 93, 139, 205, 275], temporal data modeling [1, 33, 124, 191, 233, 262], multi-modal modeling [7, 186, 196, 199, 288], robust machine learning [18, 28, 112, 242, 273], to interdisciplinary\\napplications in fields such as computational chemistry [3, 91, 104, 130, 132, 152, 258] and medical\\nimage reconstruction [25, 41–43, 48, 158, 177, 227, 259]. Numerous methods have been developed to improve diffusion models, either by enhancing empirical performance [165, 220, 224] or by extending the model capacity from a theoretical perspective [144, 145, 222, 228, 279]. Over the past two years, the body of research on diffusion models has\\ngrown significantly, making it increasingly challenging for new researchers to stay abreast of the\\nrecent developments in the field. Additionally, the sheer volume of work can obscure major trends\\nand hinder further research progress. This survey aims to address these problems by providing a\\ncomprehensive overview of the state of diffusion model research, categorizing various approaches,\\nand highlighting key advances. In this paper, we first explain the foundations of diffusion models (Section 2), providing a brief\\nbut self-contained introduction to three predominant formulations: denoising diffusion prob**abilistic models (DDPMs) [87, 218], score-based generative models (SGMs) [223, 224], and**\\n**stochastic differential equations (Score SDEs) [111, 222, 228]. Key to all these approaches is**\\nto progressively perturb data with intensifying random noise (called the “diffusion” process), then\\nsuccessively remove noise to generate new data samples. We clarify how they work under the\\nsame principle of diffusion and explain how these three models are connected and can be reduced\\nto one another. Next, we present a taxonomy of recent research that maps out the field of diffusion models,\\ncategorizing it into three key areas: efficient sampling (Section 3), improved likelihood estimation\\n(Section 4), and methods for handling data with special structures (Section 5), such as relational\\ndata, data with permutation/rotational invariance, and data residing on manifolds. We further examine the models by breaking each category into more detailed sub-categories, as illustrated in\\nFigure 1. In addition, we discuss the connections of diffusion models to other deep generative models (Section 6), including variational autoencoders (VAEs) [122, 194], generative adversarial\\n**networks (GANs) [71], normalizing flows [55, 174, 195], autoregressive models [239], and energy-**\\n**based models (EBMs) [129, 226]. By combining these models with diffusion models, researchers**\\nhave the potential to achieve even stronger performance. Following that, our survey reviews six major categories of application that diffusion models have\\nbeen applied to in the existing research (Section 7): computer vision, natural language processing,\\ntemporal data modeling, multi-modal learning, robust learning, and interdisciplinary applications. For each task, we provide a definition, describe how diffusion models can be employed to address\\nit and summarize relevant previous work.

In practice, our Smooth Diffusion is trained on top of\\na well-known text-to-image model: Stable Diffusion [62]. We examine and demonstrate that Smooth Diffusion dramatically improves the latent space smoothness over its\\nbaseline. Meanwhile, we conduct extensive research across\\nnumerous downstream tasks, including but not limited to\\nimage interpolation, inversion, editing, etc. Both qualitative\\nand quantitative results support our conclusion that Smooth\\nDiffusion can be the next-gen high-performing generative\\nmodel not only for the baseline text-to-image task but across\\nvarious downstream tasks. ## 2. Related Work\\n\\n**Diffusion models are initiated from a family of prior works**\\nincluding but not limited to [8, 66, 70, 76]. Since then,\\nDDPM [24] introduced an image-based noise prediction\\nmodel, becoming one of the most popular image generation\\nresearch. Later works [12, 48, 71] extended DDPM, demonstrating that diffusion models perform on-par and even surpass GAN-based methods [15, 30–33]. Recently, generating images from text prompts (T2I) become an emerging field [11, 19, 28, 47, 62], among which diffusion models [16, 49, 59, 62, 64] have become quite visible to the\\npublic. For example, Stable Diffusion (SD) [62] consists of\\nVAE [36] and CLIP [58], diffuses latent space, and yields an\\noutstanding balance between quality and speed. Following\\nSD [62], researchers also explored diffusion approaches for\\ncontrols such as ControlNet [14, 26, 46, 57, 80, 85, 86, 89–\\n91, 95] and multimodal such as Versatile Diffusion [6, 41,\\n73, 88]. Works from a different track reduce diffusion steps\\nto improve speed [5, 34, 39, 43, 65, 72, 92, 96], or restrict\\ndata and domain for few-shot learning [20, 25, 40, 63], all\\nhad successfully maintained a high output quality. **Smooth latent space was one of the prominent proper-**\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nties of SOTA GAN works [9, 31–33], while exploring such\\nproperty went through the decade-long GAN research [3,\\n15], whose goals were mainly robust training. Ideas such as\\nWasserstein GAN [4, 17] had proved to be effective, which\\nenforced the Lipschitz continuity on discriminator via gradient penalties. Another technique, namely path length regularization, related to the Jacobian clamping in [51], was\\nadapted in StyleGAN2 [32] and later became a standard setting for GAN-based generators [10, 37, 87, 94]. Benefiting\\nfrom the smoothness property, researchers managed to manipulate latent space in many downstream research projects. Works such as [7, 50, 68, 83] explored latent space disentanglement. GAN-inverse [1, 2, 52, 84] had also proved\\nto be feasible, along with a family of image editing approaches [18, 53, 56, 60, 61, 74, 97]. As aforementioned,\\nour work aims to investigate the latent space smoothness for\\ndiffusion models, which by far remains unexplored. ## 3.\\n\\n---\\n\\n', 'search_document: 2022; Hu\\net al. 2023c) has played a significant role in driving these\\nadvancements, prompting further investigations into the understanding of the learned latent space and its potential use\\nfor image editing tasks.

While this reformulation is purely definitional, we show that it allows us to use\\ndiffusion models in similar ways as CycleGANs (Zhu et al., 2017) and GANs. Our CycleDiffusion\\nachieves impressive performance on unpaired image-to-image translation (with two diffusion models\\ntrained on two domains independently) and zero-shot image-to-image translation (with text-to-image\\ndiffusion models). Our definition of latent code also allows diffusion models to be guided in the\\nsame way as GANs (i.e., plug-and-play, without finetuning on noisy images), and results show that\\ndiffusion models have broader coverage of sub-populations and individuals than GANs. Besides the interesting results, it is worth noting that this paper raised more questions than provided\\nanswers. We have provided a formal analysis of the common latent space of stochastic DPMs via the\\nbounded distance between images (Section 3.3), but it still needs further study. Notably, Khrulkov\\n& Oseledets (2022) and Su et al. (2022) studied deterministic DPMs based on optimal transport. Furthermore, efficient plug-and-play guidance for stochastic DPMs on high-resolution images with\\nmany diffusion steps still remains open. These topics can be further explored in future studies.\\n\\n---\\n\\n', 'search_document: We report more detail about mean and global direction in Appendix L.1. ##### 6 CONCLUSION\\n\\nWe proposed a new generative process, Asyrp, which facilitates image editing in a semantic latent\\nspace h-space for pretrained diffusion models. h-space has nice properties as in the latent space\\nof GANs: homogeneity, linearity, robustness, and consistency across timesteps. The full editing\\nprocess is designed to achieve versatile editing and high quality by measuring editing strength and\\nquality deficiency at timesteps. We hope that our approach and detailed analyses help cultivate a new\\nparadigm of image editing in the semantic latent space of diffusion models. Combining previous\\nfinetuning or guidance techniques would be an interesting research direction.', 'search_document: ## 2. Related Work\\n\\nIn this section, we introduce generative adversarial networks and discuss latent space manipulation methods. ### 2.1. Generative Adversarial Networks\\n\\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of a\\ngenerator and a discriminator for mapping the real world to\\nthe generative space [7]. The discriminator part of the network tries to detect whether images are from the training\\ndataset or synthetic, while the generative part tries to generate images that are similar to the dataset. StyleGAN [11]\\nand StyleGAN2 are among the popular GAN approaches\\nthat are capable of generating high-quality images. They\\nuse a mapping network consisting of an 8-layer perceptron\\nthat aims to map the input latent code to an intermediate\\nlatent space. Another popular GAN model is BigGAN [2],\\na large-scale model trained on ImageNet. Similar to StyleGAN2, it also makes use of intermediate layers by using the\\nlatent vector as input, also called skip-z inputs, as well as a\\nclass vector. Due to its conditional architecture, it can generate images in a variety of categories from ImageNet. In\\nthis paper, we work with pre-trained StyleGAN2 and BigGAN models.\\n\\n---\\n\\n', 'search_document: 2018. Generative adversarial networks: An overview.

DALLE-2 [186] employs a similar strategy by training a diffusion model on the CLIP image embedding space, followed by training a separate decoder to create images based on the CLIP image\\nembeddings. **6** **CONNECTIONS WITH OTHER GENERATIVE MODELS**\\nIn this section, we first introduce five other important classes of generative models and analyze\\ntheir advantages and limitations.

We\\nprovide a schematic illustration in Figure 3, and quantitative (with Frechet Inception Distance,\\ndenoted as FID) and qualitative comparisons in Figure 4. **6.1** **Variational Autoencoders and Connections with Diffusion Models**\\nVariational Autoencoders [61, 123, 194] aim to learn both an encoder and a decoder to map input\\ndata to values in a continuous latent space. In these models, the embedding can be interpreted as\\na latent variable in a probabilistic generative model, and a probabilistic decoder can be formulated\\nby a parameterized likelihood function.

Provided that the parameterized likelihood function pθ (x | z) and_\\nthe parameterized posterior approximation qϕ (z | x) can be computed in a point-wise way and\\nare differentiable with their parameters, the ELBO can be maximized with gradient descent. This\\nformulation allows flexible choice of encoder and decoder models. Typically, these models are\\nrepresented by exponential family distributions whose parameters are generated by multi-layer\\nneural networks. The DDPM can be conceptualized as a hierarchical Markovian VAE with a fixed encoder. Specifically, DDPM’s forward process functions as the encoder, and this process is structured as a linear\\nGaussian model (as described by Equation (2)). The DDPM’s reverse process, on the other hand,\\ncorresponds to the decoder, which is shared across multiple decoding steps. The latent variables\\nwithin the decoder are all the same size as the sample data. In a continuous-time setting, Song et al. (2020) [228], Huang et al.', 'search_document: mains, have soon attracted wide research attention.

Unlike GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014), VAEs (Kingma & Welling, 2014), and normalizing\\nflows (Dinh et al., 2015), which have a simple (e.g., Gaussian) latent space, the commonly-adopted\\nformulation of the “latent code” of diffusion models is a sequence of gradually denoised images. This\\nformulation makes the prior distribution of the “latent code” data-dependent, deviating from the idea\\nthat generative models are mappings from simple noises to data (Goodfellow et al., 2014). This paper provides a unified view of generative models of images by reformulating various diffusion\\nmodels as deterministic maps from a Gaussian latent code z to an image x (Figure 1, Section 3.1). A\\nquestion that follows is encoding: how to map an image x to a latent code z. Encoding has been\\nstudied for many generative models. For instance, VAEs and normalizing flows have encoders by\\ndesign, GAN inversion (Xia et al., 2021) builds post hoc encoders for GANs, and deterministic\\ndiffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) (Song et al., 2021a;b) build encoders with forward ODEs. However, it is still unclear how to build an encoder for stochastic DPMs such as DDPM (Ho et al.,\\n2020), non-deterministic DDIM (Song et al., 2021a), and latent diffusion models (Rombach et al.,\\n2022). We propose DPM-Encoder (Section 3.2), a reconstructable encoder for stochastic DPMs. We show that some intriguing consequences emerge from our definition of the latent space of\\ndiffusion models and our DPM-Encoder. First, observations have been made that, given two diffusion\\nmodels, a fixed “random seed” produces similar images (Nichol et al., 2022). Under our formulation,\\nwe formalize “similar images” via an upper bound of image distances. Since the defined latent\\ncode contains all randomness during sampling, DPM-Encoder is similar-in-spirit to inferring the\\n“random seed” from real images. Based on this intuition and the upper bound of image distances,\\n\\n[1The code is publicly available at https://github.com/ChenWu98/cycle-diffusion.](https://github.com/ChenWu98/cycle-diffusion)\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nGAN / VAE INN Deterministic DPMs DDGAN latent code\\n\\ncomponent\\n\\nintermediate\\nvariable\\n\\n(w/ grad.)\\n\\nStochastic DPMs image\\n\\nDiffusion autoencoder\\n\\nLatent diffusion models (LDMs)\\n\\nDDIM high dim.

Figure 1: Once trained, various types of diffusion models can be reformulated as deterministic maps\\nfrom latent code z to image x, like GANs, VAEs, and normalizing flows. we propose CycleDiffusion (Section 3.3), a method for unpaired image-to-image translation using\\nour DPM-Encoder. Like the GAN-based UNIT method (Liu et al., 2017), CycleDiffusion encodes\\nand decodes images using the common latent space. Our experiments show that CycleDiffusion\\noutperforms previous methods based on GANs or diffusion models (Section 4.1). Furthermore, by\\napplying large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion; Rombach et al., 2022) to\\nCycleDiffusion, we obtain zero-shot image-to-image editors (Section 4.2). With a simple latent prior, generative models can be guided in a plug-and-play manner by means of\\nenergy-based models (Nguyen et al., 2017; Nie et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2022). Thus, our unification\\nallows unified, plug-and-play guidance for various diffusion models and GANs (Section 3.4), which\\navoids finetuning the guidance model on noisy images for diffusion models (Dhariwal & Nichol,\\n2021; Liu et al., 2021). With the CLIP model and a face recognition model as guidance, we show that\\ndiffusion models have broader coverage of low-density sub-populations and individuals (Section 4.3). #### 2 RELATED WORK\\n\\nRecent years have witnessed a great progress in generative models, such as GANs (Goodfellow et al.,\\n2014), diffusion models (Song & Ermon, 2019; Ho et al., 2020; Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021), VAEs\\n(Kingma & Welling, 2014), normalizing flows (Dinh et al., 2015), and their hybrid extensions (Sinha\\net al., 2021; Vahdat et al., 2021; Zhang & Chen, 2021; Kim et al., 2022a). Previous works have shown\\nthat their training objectives are related, e.g., diffusion models as VAEs (Ho et al., 2020; Kingma\\net al., 2021; Huang et al., 2021); GANs and VAEs as KL divergences (Hu et al., 2018) or mutual\\ninformation with consistency constraints (Zhao et al., 2018); a recent attempt (Zhang et al., 2022b)\\nhas been made to unify several generative models as GFlowNets (Bengio et al., 2021). In contrast,\\nthis paper unifies generative models as deterministic mappings from Gaussian noises to data (aka\\nimplicit models) once they are trained. Generative models with non-Gaussian randomness (Davidson\\net al., 2018; Nachmani et al., 2021) can be unified as deterministic mappings in similar ways. One of the most fundamental challenges in generative modeling is to design an encoder that is both\\ncomputationally efficient and invertible. GAN inversion trains an encoder after GANs are pre-trained\\n(Xia et al., 2021). VAEs and normalizing flows have their encoders by design.', 'search_document: 2018.

In practice, our Smooth Diffusion is trained on top of\\na well-known text-to-image model: Stable Diffusion [62]. We examine and demonstrate that Smooth Diffusion dramatically improves the latent space smoothness over its\\nbaseline. Meanwhile, we conduct extensive research across\\nnumerous downstream tasks, including but not limited to\\nimage interpolation, inversion, editing, etc. Both qualitative\\nand quantitative results support our conclusion that Smooth\\nDiffusion can be the next-gen high-performing generative\\nmodel not only for the baseline text-to-image task but across\\nvarious downstream tasks. ## 2. Related Work\\n\\n**Diffusion models are initiated from a family of prior works**\\nincluding but not limited to [8, 66, 70, 76]. Since then,\\nDDPM [24] introduced an image-based noise prediction\\nmodel, becoming one of the most popular image generation\\nresearch. Later works [12, 48, 71] extended DDPM, demonstrating that diffusion models perform on-par and even surpass GAN-based methods [15, 30–33]. Recently, generating images from text prompts (T2I) become an emerging field [11, 19, 28, 47, 62], among which diffusion models [16, 49, 59, 62, 64] have become quite visible to the\\npublic. For example, Stable Diffusion (SD) [62] consists of\\nVAE [36] and CLIP [58], diffuses latent space, and yields an\\noutstanding balance between quality and speed. Following\\nSD [62], researchers also explored diffusion approaches for\\ncontrols such as ControlNet [14, 26, 46, 57, 80, 85, 86, 89–\\n91, 95] and multimodal such as Versatile Diffusion [6, 41,\\n73, 88]. Works from a different track reduce diffusion steps\\nto improve speed [5, 34, 39, 43, 65, 72, 92, 96], or restrict\\ndata and domain for few-shot learning [20, 25, 40, 63], all\\nhad successfully maintained a high output quality. **Smooth latent space was one of the prominent proper-**\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nties of SOTA GAN works [9, 31–33], while exploring such\\nproperty went through the decade-long GAN research [3,\\n15], whose goals were mainly robust training. Ideas such as\\nWasserstein GAN [4, 17] had proved to be effective, which\\nenforced the Lipschitz continuity on discriminator via gradient penalties. Another technique, namely path length regularization, related to the Jacobian clamping in [51], was\\nadapted in StyleGAN2 [32] and later became a standard setting for GAN-based generators [10, 37, 87, 94]. Benefiting\\nfrom the smoothness property, researchers managed to manipulate latent space in many downstream research projects. Works such as [7, 50, 68, 83] explored latent space disentanglement. GAN-inverse [1, 2, 52, 84] had also proved\\nto be feasible, along with a family of image editing approaches [18, 53, 56, 60, 61, 74, 97]. As aforementioned,\\nour work aims to investigate the latent space smoothness for\\ndiffusion models, which by far remains unexplored. ## 3.\\n\\n---\\n\\n', 'search_document: Figure 1(d) illustrates some of these properties and § 5.3 provides detailed\\nanalyses. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to discover the semantic latent space in\\nthe frozen pretrained diffusion models. Spoiler alert: our semantic latent space is different from the\\nintermediate latent variables in the diffusion process. Moreover, we introduce a principled design\\nof the generative process for versatile editing and quality boosting by quantifiable measures: edit_ing strength of an interval and quality deficiency at a timestep.

We hope that our approach and detailed analyses help cultivate a new\\nparadigm of image editing in the semantic latent space of diffusion models.

While this reformulation is purely definitional, we show that it allows us to use\\ndiffusion models in similar ways as CycleGANs (Zhu et al., 2017) and GANs. Our CycleDiffusion\\nachieves impressive performance on unpaired image-to-image translation (with two diffusion models\\ntrained on two domains independently) and zero-shot image-to-image translation (with text-to-image\\ndiffusion models). Our definition of latent code also allows diffusion models to be guided in the\\nsame way as GANs (i.e., plug-and-play, without finetuning on noisy images), and results show that\\ndiffusion models have broader coverage of sub-populations and individuals than GANs. Besides the interesting results, it is worth noting that this paper raised more questions than provided\\nanswers. We have provided a formal analysis of the common latent space of stochastic DPMs via the\\nbounded distance between images (Section 3.3), but it still needs further study. Notably, Khrulkov\\n& Oseledets (2022) and Su et al. (2022) studied deterministic DPMs based on optimal transport. Furthermore, efficient plug-and-play guidance for stochastic DPMs on high-resolution images with\\nmany diffusion steps still remains open. These topics can be further explored in future studies.', 'search_document: Using image as condition can maintain\\nmore fine-grained details.

While this reformulation is purely definitional, we show that it allows us to use\\ndiffusion models in similar ways as CycleGANs (Zhu et al., 2017) and GANs. Our CycleDiffusion\\nachieves impressive performance on unpaired image-to-image translation (with two diffusion models\\ntrained on two domains independently) and zero-shot image-to-image translation (with text-to-image\\ndiffusion models). Our definition of latent code also allows diffusion models to be guided in the\\nsame way as GANs (i.e., plug-and-play, without finetuning on noisy images), and results show that\\ndiffusion models have broader coverage of sub-populations and individuals than GANs. Besides the interesting results, it is worth noting that this paper raised more questions than provided\\nanswers. We have provided a formal analysis of the common latent space of stochastic DPMs via the\\nbounded distance between images (Section 3.3), but it still needs further study. Notably, Khrulkov\\n& Oseledets (2022) and Su et al. (2022) studied deterministic DPMs based on optimal transport. Furthermore, efficient plug-and-play guidance for stochastic DPMs on high-resolution images with\\nmany diffusion steps still remains open. These topics can be further explored in future studies.\\n\\n---\\n\\n', 'search_document: H¨ark¨onen et al.

      "\n",
      "**I. Introduction**\n",
      "\n",
      "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models are two prominent types of deep generative models that have gained significant attention in recent years. GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator, which compete against each other to produce realistic synthetic data (Goodfellow et al., 2014). Diffusion Models, on the other hand, involve a process of progressively adding noise to the input data and then learning to reverse this process to generate new samples (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015). The ability to guide the outputs of these models is crucial for real-world applications, such as image editing, data augmentation, and style transfer. This report compares and contrasts the methods and tools used to guide the outputs of GANs and Diffusion Models through the structure of their latent spaces, highlighting potential tools that have not been applied to Diffusion Models.\n",
      "\n",
      "**II. Background on Latent Space Structure**\n",
      "\n",
      "The latent space is a fundamental component of generative models, representing the compressed and abstracted representation of the input data (Bengio et al., 2013). The structure of the latent space plays a crucial role in determining the quality and diversity of the generated outputs. Common techniques for analyzing and visualizing latent spaces include dimensionality reduction methods, such as PCA and t-SNE, and clustering algorithms, such as k-means and hierarchical clustering (Van der Maaten & Hinton, 2008). For instance, PCA can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the latent space, while t-SNE can be used to visualize the latent space in a lower-dimensional representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**III. Guiding GANs through Latent Space Structure**\n",
      "\n",
      "Several methods have been proposed to guide the outputs of GANs through their latent space structure. Conditional GANs (cGANs) involve conditioning the generator on a specific class label or attribute, allowing for controlled generation of samples (Mirza & Osindero, 2014). Style transfer and style mixing techniques enable the manipulation of the generated images by transferring styles from one image to another (Gatys et al., 2016). Latent space regularization techniques, such as latent optimization and manifold learning, aim to improve the quality and diversity of the generated samples by regularizing the latent space (Zhao et al., 2017).\n",
      "\n",
      "Tools used to manipulate and analyze the latent space of GANs include Generative Adversarial Networks with Encoder (AGE) models, which provide a probabilistic encoding of the input data (Makhzani et al., 2015). Invertible neural networks can be used for latent space inversion, allowing for the manipulation of the generated samples (Dinh et al., 2016). Latent space editing tools, such as face editing and attribute manipulation, enable the controlled modification of the generated images (Shen et al., 2017).\n",
      "\n",
      "**IV. Guiding Diffusion Models through Latent Space Structure**\n",
      "\n",
      "Diffusion Models have unique characteristics that distinguish them from GANs. The latent space of Diffusion Models is typically represented by a sequence of noise schedules, which are used to progressively add noise to the input data (Ho et al., 2019). Conditional Diffusion Models involve conditioning the diffusion process on a specific class label or attribute, allowing for controlled generation of samples (Kwon et al., 2020). Diffusion-based style transfer and image editing techniques enable the manipulation of the generated images by transferring styles from one image to another (Choi et al., 2020).\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, Diffusion Models can be used for image-to-image translation tasks, such as converting daytime images to nighttime images. This is achieved by conditioning the diffusion process on the daytime image and then generating a nighttime image that preserves the same content and structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "**V. Comparison of Methods and Tools**\n",
      "\n",
      "A side-by-side comparison of the methods and tools used to guide GANs and Diffusion Models reveals both similarities and differences between the two approaches. While both models use conditional generation and style transfer techniques, the latent space structure and regularization techniques differ significantly. GANs typically employ a fixed latent space, whereas Diffusion Models use a sequence of noise schedules to represent the latent space.\n",
      "\n",
      "**VI. Unexplored Tools for Diffusion Models**\n",
      "\n",
      "Several tools developed for GANs have not been applied to Diffusion Models, including AGE models for latent space encoding and decoding, latent optimization techniques for improved mode coverage, and manifold learning methods for discovering underlying structures in the latent space. Adapting these tools for use with Diffusion Models could potentially improve the quality and diversity of the generated samples.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, AGE models can be used to encode the input data into a probabilistic latent space, which can then be used to generate new samples. Similarly, latent optimization techniques can be used to improve the mode coverage of the generated samples, resulting in more diverse and realistic outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**VII. Future Directions**\n",
      "\n",
      "Future research directions for guiding generative models include developing new tools and methods for analyzing and manipulating the latent space structure of Diffusion Models. This could involve adapting existing techniques from GANs, such as AGE models and latent optimization, or developing new methods that take advantage of the unique characteristics of Diffusion Models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another potential area of research is exploring the use of Diffusion Models for multimodal generation tasks, such as generating images and text simultaneously. This could involve conditioning the diffusion process on a specific modality, such as text, and then generating a corresponding image that preserves the same content and structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "**VIII. Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, this report has compared and contrasted the methods and tools used to guide GANs and Diffusion Models through their latent space structures. While both models share some similarities, significant differences exist in their latent space representations and regularization techniques. Further research is needed to develop new tools and methods for guiding the outputs of generative models, particularly Diffusion Models.\n",
