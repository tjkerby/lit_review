# Log to orient myself in my work

## TODO
* Chunk these papers and save off each paper as a chunk node with associated attributes - see https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/knowledge-graphs-rag for help
* Work on RAG with KG to improve question answering capabilities

## Nice to haves
* Work on building a workflow to tag papers by subject or other things
* Add author H-index attribute
* Add Journal or Conference nodes to see where things are published

## Completed
* Create basic KG from api calls to semantic scholar
* Create embeddings for abstracts
* Get a list of pdfs for the papers I'm interested in
